Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that ~~will work.~~

**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",2021-01-29 21:17:25

I am trying to catch the message – so don’t expect a word by word translation as you can never catch the greatness of the text in it’s entirety and I got to translate it in a way that even a US degenerate can follow it.

As usual no financial advice, I more or less just copied the text because I liked the text and I like the share. In general I have likely lost more than I won and the stock market is a mystery in itself to me. So make your own due dilligence and don’t trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).

**Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World – let me get this straight!**

In the coming days I don’t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of „this is over“, „we missed the squeeze“, „I am going to loose it all“, „entered at 320$ - I am doomed“. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.

**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**

You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET – yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! – and follow DD posted by people with names like „SHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS“? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry „One-Wish-comes-true“ show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn’t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don’t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments – this is about „get rich or die trying!“. This is not r/investing!

**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**

If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this „Saudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts – but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don’t know what’s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now – could be though the next big thing – got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET – the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize – you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn’t do if you like the system).

**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? 😓**

So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It’s a fucking global movement now (or not – could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have 🙌💎and the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy – we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven’t understand the concept or how this works – speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up – desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors – shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious – you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let’s be fucking honest – most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody – I even don’t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it – we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That’s it. If we are right – this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock – do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought – hmmmm makes sense – I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don’t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) – no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the 🚀 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please – no post without 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 and if you want to fukn leave the party – leave – but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I’d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  – I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have 🙌💎

"Analysis on Why Hedge Funds Didn't Reposition Last Thursday, Why They Didn't Cover on Friday, and Why They Want You to Think They Did. (GME)",41500,ldjbg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldjbg1/analysis_on_why_hedge_funds_didnt_reposition_last/,3716,1612593568.0,"Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.

I know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.🚀🚀🚀

**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)

[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

Per S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.

Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.

To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.

This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**

Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**

Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.

So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.

This likely didn't happen, for several reasons. 

First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.

Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. 

Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. 

Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** 

What is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**

That means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.

**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**

Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.

[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)

[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)

Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**

S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.

[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

So on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**

**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**

Furthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.

[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an &gt;100% increase.

They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?

There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of &gt;31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? 

**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**

[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**

There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.

Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. 

They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.

TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.

Edit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl


Edit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....

SOBER REVIEW TIME - what are the actual data we can use to assess GME as of today?,35334,lbaktb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/,3587,1612339673.0,"*Edit: There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the comments! Will try to incorporate that into the post as I go, or make a followup tomorrow!*  


  
First off, my position: 1900 shares of GME @ 30, plus 5 calls @ $250. Peak value was nearly 500k.

https://preview.redd.it/96g5d07z45f61.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e983f8d1a6b56bcf4201d32a56b0c2535886d5b

*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*

\*\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\*\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.

Here's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**

There is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.

How do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.

**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**

1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.
2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.
3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.
4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.
5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:
   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.
   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling
   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver
   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),
   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.

&#x200B;

**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**

***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***

&#x200B;

No, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.

**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**

* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?
   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)

&#x200B;

* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)

https://preview.redd.it/yo2s5e2cg5f61.png?width=1691&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83701a452b5aaa079e3a3948cecbbb3feb77b5a

&#x200B;

* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\*\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\*\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.
* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?
   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?
   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**

* Claim: assuming \~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.
* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.

|Date|Trade Volume|
|:-|:-|
|2/2 Tue|77.8m|
|2/1 Mon|37.3m|
|1/29 Fri|50.5m|
|1/28 Thu|58.5m|
|1/27 Wed|93.3m|

**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**

* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit
* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further

&#x200B;

**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**

* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.
* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS
* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

https://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2

* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.
* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.
* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.

&#x200B;

**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**

* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.
* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices

   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)
* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\_ladders\_are\_not\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)
* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\
* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?
* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

&#x200B;

**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**

* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.
* Evidence: A single, solitary chart

https://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131

* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?
* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play

Robinhood Is Lying - You Are Blocked Acquiring More Than 5 Total Shares,33661,l7q1et,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7q1et/robinhood_is_lying_you_are_blocked_acquiring_more/,1782,1611947513.0,"Vlad, CEO of RH and chief mod at r/cuckold, went on national news outlets last night and swore RH would open trading of GME. 

That is not entirely true. 

RH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. 

This is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. 

They are simultaneously:
1)  manipulating the system
2) taking advantage of people with less funds
3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased

They did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say “We reopened stock purchase of GME” and nobody will dig deeper. 

This is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. 

Here’s the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa

Edit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.

Edit 2: I’m not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas “The Shit Engine” Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it’s overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what’s overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo

Edit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.

Edit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.

Here’s the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg

#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.

People will try to gaslight you into believing that playing $GME is wrong or something to be ashamed of. But keep the following in mind...,23857,l6eqqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6eqqu/people_will_try_to_gaslight_you_into_believing/,950,1611811553.0,"Inevitably, there will be a smear campaign led by certain organizations and media members against retail traders who are getting in on $GME. One argument that will be made is that it's not fair that we made so much money by recognizing that a group of hedge funds and institutions were in over their heads. It hurts the market and we should feel bad for exploiting them.

The total market cap of $GME is around $12B as I'm writing this. **The total market cap of Wall Street is around $50T.** That means we've currently displaced about .025% of the total value of the US stock market. I will type that out to reiterate: we (retail traders) have displaced approximately one quarter of one tenth of one percent of the total market cap. To claim that we are doing anything which is tremendously harmful to the whole market is absolutely pants-on-fire lies. Is this going to change some elements of the market moving into the future? Almost certainly. But even if this stock goes to $1000 per share, we are still only talking about less than one tenth of one percent of the total market cap that's out there. 

If you're looking at your RH balance right now  and thinking ""wow, that's a lot of money, am I doing something wrong? Illegal, even?"" the answer is **ABSOLUTELY NOT.** What you are beginning to notice is that the wealth gap in this country is absolutely massive. Thousands upon thousands of people could make year changing or life changing money out of this squeeze and it'll hardly be a blip on Wall Street's radar. Greed is absolutely out of control at the top and this funny little news story is tangible proof of that. Do not let them gaslight you into thinking that it's wrong for you to get a slightly larger sliver of the pie. 

Good luck to everyone playing this. I've got 100 shares at a cost basis of $103.95. I might not make millions, but I might be able to make a dent in my student loans, or pay off my car, or something that makes me just a little more hopeful that I'll be able to live some sort of ""American Dream"" before I'm old and wrinkled.

edit: and in the event that you're literally brand new to trading (we're getting a lot of new people here), I would highly encourage you to read up on investment basics (there are literally millions of resources on this) and do some research into $GME and why it's moving the way it is. I would not recommend taking a position on any stock if you can't articulate your own reason as to why you're invested in it.",2021-01-27 22:25:53
I used to work @ Merrill. Here's what likely happened today with Robinhood and what it means for short-squeezing investors,20625,l7fw0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fw0x/i_used_to_work_merrill_heres_what_likely_happened/,2309,1611914262.0,"I just wanted to throw this out there in the middle of the outrage, in the hopes that someone can take it in and strategize, rather than be upset. Worked @ Merrill as an analyst from ** - **.

I also like to keep it concise so follow along. This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction.

Disclaimer: I own GME. This is not financial advice. This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies.

---------------------------------------------------------
1) **Robinhood, restrictions, suppression**: 

When you place an order through RH, Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread; However, the transaction is not complete.

Enter: Clearing house. The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter-parties. Because they stand between sellers & buyers, they have very defined levels of risk, risk management and regulation to be in front of.  The clearing house is who gives you the ""title"" for your shares, the folks who make it official.

**What Likely Happened**: The risk department retard @ the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C-Suite frazzled; He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form; turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert. It's simply not enough.

In addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you're on your own; we ain't gonna help you. SEC is sneaky like that; they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves. If you're not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists.

So, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn't enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a ""failure to deliver""? 

---------------------------

2) **Failure to Deliver**:

This is a pretty big deal because it's basically a slam-dunk law suit. 

Failure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn't enough for everyone. 

It has been on the FTD list for a month already. Thousands (or possibly hundreds of thousands) of failures to deliver =  big risk


---------------------------

3) **Liability**: 

You must be asking so what? Fuck them; They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck; That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple. Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions. If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER. How many people have options on GME on RH? Half? Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house. There would be no Robinhood left. There would likely be no clearing house left. 

Robinhood is also a shitshow of a company, so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T-Mobile, they had to pull the plug. This lack of collateral from Robinhood is important to note because the ""music"" never stops, trading low float/volatile shares just becomes much more collateral heavy on the side of the broker.

Hence: Bad Decision > Bankruptcy or worse (WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively)


I personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH; there's definitely coordination all around, but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal.

---------------------------


Couple of semi-related notes:

-Fuck Billionaires. Parasites of modern society, simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people. Something is needed. Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet.

-I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel (the HF) would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC. They cleared over 6 billion net last year, so just logically, it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this. It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel, simply because it's such a money maker. If you were an evil genius, would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short?

-The media just wants clicks and engagement, so they will bring the worst people on, simply to pad their own bottom line. Don't get engaged. Don't give in to them. Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall-street however you please.

-The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive, not reactive. 

- **TL;DR**: There's simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened, hence restrictions.

- **What will happen now**:Based on my previous short squeezes, Friday (tomorrow) will be nuts; All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float, I'm guessing up.

"The anatomy of a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack - why GME’s real price is $2,147,483,737",17944,lc2dpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc2dpx/the_anatomy_of_a_short_escalator_omega_overflow/,2199,1612426129.0,"Hey diamond hands,

as I am sure you have heard, there are rumors that short ladder attacks are being used to suppress the price of GME. While I held this belief for many days, I am now beginning to realize that even more insidious and backhanded techniques are being used against us. I mean seriously, there is simply no reasonable explanation for why a stock should drop in price. None.

The good news is that Melvin is more scared than ever. The bad news is that today was no short ladder attack. No, it was far worse.

Today we experienced a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack

Most people here have at least a few days of investing experience under their belts, so I'm not going to dumb down these concepts for you. If you can understand a short ladder attack, you can understand this tactic as well.

Basically, a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack (or Overflow attack for short) is the opposite of a short ladder attack. In a short ladder attack, shares are traded back and forth, with each trade a penny lower. In an overflow attack, the attack chooses to instead trade shares to an accomplice at incredibly high prices. How high you ask?

$2,147,483,648

That's right, hedge funds have been selling single shares for billions of dollars right behind our backs. Why this price though? It's simple.

Every investment app, RH, TD, etc, use 32 bit integers to store prices. The maximum value of a 32 bit integer is 2,147,483,647. So what happens when it goes up by one? It goes negative.

This means that every share in an overflow attack is worth:  -$2,147,483,647

What do you think this does to the price of a stock? If you answered bad things, you are correct. The sale of one of these shares is enough to send the price of a stock far into the negatives. Didn't think that stocks could go negative? I'm not surprised - that's another hedge fund secret. They don't tell you THAT on investopedia!

But as the critical thinkers you are, I'm sure you will now ask:

""Why isn't the stock price negative right now?""

The answer is because the squeeze is happening RIGHT NOW. Paper hands laughed at the idea of an infinity squeeze, but it happened and it was big. So big in fact that it overflowed the price itself.

MATH TIME

So we know that GME overflowed in the squeeze. But by how much? Well we know that the price right now is $90. But we have to take the overflow squeeze into consideration.

If there is -$2,147,483,557 of pressure on prices, then to reach $90 the stock must cost 2,147,483,647 + 90, or $2,147,483,737. Yes.

EACH SHARE OF GME IS CURRENTLY WORTH $2,147,483,737

We can't forget about overflow however, so the price stored in your brokerage account is actually -$1,073,741,734. Now this might sounds like a scary number, but as long as you didn't buy on margin you will be fine. As long as you keep holding, the SEC will be FORCED to do something about it. They are already under extreme pressure to help retail investors - it's only a matter of time.

And as a side note: If for some reason Melvin stops this overflow attack, your stocks will be worth over a billion negative dollars. At this point, buying GME makes a profit whereas selling puts the next 10 generations of you family into debt enslavement. So as the wise investors on WSB say: BUY!

WE DESERVE OUR BILLIONS

Listen.

Fidelity and Vanguard are in a class of their own when it comes to retail brokers available to retail investors. Shithood, Interactive Dumbasses and so on do NOT compare. 

Shithood is a little startup that has to answer to hedge funds, HFTs (their main customers of order flow buys), and venture capitalists. Shithood CEO has no fucking idea what he's doing and is clearly vested in our failure.

## **Fidelity and Vanguard** 🚀🚀✅

Here come the big fucking boys!

Fidelity has **$3.3 trillion**, YES trillion, in assets under management. Vanguard has **$8.8 trillion** in assets under management. I am saying TRILLIONS, not little billions.

Guess what? **THEY ANSWER TO NO FUCKING ONE**.

## **Fidelity owns 13.67% of GME shares.** 💸💸💸

And Vanguard? 6.27% of GME shares.

We need to talk about NOK,8360,l6rmkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6rmkl/we_need_to_talk_about_nok/,2832,1611850644.0,"&#x200B;

**Feb 4, mid-market:** Thank you everyone for your support. I really don't know what to say. The company keeps getting pounded because GME is having a sell-off, which doesn't make any sense. But that's the market for you. It doesn't always make sense.

I still believe 2021 will be a big year for Nokia, although it doesn't look like there is any way we'll manage the crazy play anymore. Still, it was nice to see something that was impossible become possible, even if it was for only a few days.

And remember, we can still do it any day. All it takes is for us to work together. If you want. Make up your own mind. 

I'm still holding. NOK will recover from this. Fair value is at least 4.81, and way more when 5G really gets going. So if you can, I would buy some more now. You'll thank me later for the tip. It may not be the most exciting play, but it is what investing is all about. Slow and steady growth that compounds to make a big change.

One of these days I'll be able to post again, when the mods lift the restrictions on new posts and things get a little less crazy around here. When I post again about NOK, I'll post the link here too. Thanks everyone!

**Feb 4 premarket:** Earnings out! They beat expectations a bit, their revenue was a little smaller than expected. Overall, good quarter, good year. Here it is: [https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia\_results\_2020\_q4.pdf](https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-02/nokia_results_2020_q4.pdf)

**Feb 2, end of da**y: It's getting pretty crazy out there, but here's what you should know. The NOK chart is following the GME chart. It's got way more shares so the bumps and dips are more stable, but that's the main trend.

**What that means**: GME has no underlying value at this level. It is a gamble on the short squeeze. It might pay off, or it might not. If people panic sell like yesterday, it won't.

NOK is very different. It has underlying value. So if someone dumps it below its target price, the best thing to do is just to buy and wait for the value to go down. Thursday NOK reveals its earnings, and they are likely to be good based on what Ericsson revealed. Ericsson is one of its main competitors and a very similar company currently trading at twice the NOK price.

Feb 1, end of day: Told you it was a value share! Still trading at target, still low risk.

Either dumping has stopped, or normies are piling in because of the results. Either way good news, hope you made some money today!Vol today 190m, still way above average. Normal average 30m before we changed it lol. That means since Wednesday over 2bn shares have changed hands. Hope you got em!

Ericsson (NOK competitor) results suggest NOK will report good numbers this week, NOK upped to BUY on market watch: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nokia-upped-to-buy-after-ericsson-results-2021-02-01)

Unless my math is retarded (which it is cos ahmsodumb), if everyone (7m) on this sub spends $3000 at current price ($4.55) we BUY THE FLOAT. The more they keep dumping, the more shares we get cheap. Think about it.EDIT: buying the ENTIRE float is NOT the point of this play. I know share price goes up when supply is restricted, just read the play. This is just an example of what happens when they dump a value share on millions of retail investors.

Added new summary (30 Jan), and Q&A.

FIRST OFF: This post is not financial advice or anything except the rant of some idiot retard who is an idiot. I tell you straight up that there is a normal investment side to the NOK play (STILL MEANS RISK, which YOU will have to decide!) and that there is a CRAZY side that is PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE. If you want to play the crazy play then you’re also a crazy retard idiot just like me.

I don’t know shit, I just look at graphs and go WOW. Do your own due diligence, I am not a financial advisor. Don’t ask me if you should buy, I don’t know, can you afford to? Are you comfortable with the risks? I don’t know these things. You do.

**NOK PLAY:**

Here’s how it works. YOU DECIDE if you want to take part.

1.It’s **not a short squeeze like GME**. Get that out of your head.

2.It’s a **value/momentum** play. The value part is just normal granny&grampa investing. See a good company going cheap, buy and hold. Tell your mom, dad, granny and grampa, cousins, relatives, friends.

3.The **momentum part is the crazy part**, and if it works the share will SKYROCKET as long as YOU DON’T SELL. GME is the biggest short squeeze in history, the NOK play could be the biggest value buy in history.

4. The beauty of it is that **it works because Wall St is dumping NOK irrationally**. That’s why the price is going down (slowly). They think they’re attacking us and slowly winning, but they’re giving us a value share cheap = their money, our pockets. By the time they realize what we did, it will be too late.

5. **Don’t panic, and keep buying the dumps (if you think the company has value)**, and if we hold the line **you could see a miracle.**

3310 HANDS

&#x200B;

**Value Part (crazy part in Q&A):**

The company is healthy, has good financials, it’s a market leader in 5G (it’s main competitors are Huawei and Ericsson, they have about the same market share share of 5G) a lot of potential to be the company that builds 5G for a large part of the world. NOK is currently trading at a standard price for the value it holds. It is not a bubble.

Here’s Nokia’s 5G contracts: [https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/)

Here’s Bloomberg shitting bricks that we’ve realized that Nokia is a value bet: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-28/gamestop-may-be-a-reddit-wallstreetbets-game-but-nokia-sure-isn-t)

Nokia also just unveiled new 1tb tech, the thing AFTER 5G. First on the world. They have it, they’re showing the world it works. Here is their press release from Wednesday: [https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment-2021-01-27)

They are so trusted that NASA got them to build a cell network on the MOON. Literally. If you’re NASA, would you hire your retard uncle Earl to build cell towers on the moon? No, you hire someone who CAN ACTUALLY DO IT. Imagine what it takes to build something really big and complicated on the moon? Now imagine who’s the likely guy who can do it. That’s right, NOKIA. Here they are, going to the moon: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

If the Huawei 5G war continues, who do you think US and Europe is going to back, especially since NOK already has the next tech, owns a bunch of patents, is from FINLAND that has never tried to take over the world and has a brand that EVERYONE who lived in 2000s remembers?

Here’s a guy who’s been doing the numbers for a while now in case you want to see them: [https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part\_iv\_option\_chain\_analysis\_on\_nok\_and\_why\_you/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jimming/comments/l7f6ua/part_iv_option_chain_analysis_on_nok_and_why_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I don’t know him, I don’t know the numbers as well, but looks pretty good to me. Amazing due diligence. But what do I know, I’m an idiot. So is he. So are you. We’re all fucking retards, just ask Wall Street. I poked myself in the same eye twice yesterday. We’re “dumb money”. They have other names for us too.

So, worst case, you just bought into a good company at a fair value. If the crazy play doesn’t work, you just hold on to them and let them become the world leader in 5G. Unlike GME (NOT SAYING SELL!), NOK will not fall 99%. Or if it does, I'M BUYING THAT SHIT because if a HEALTHY COMPANY FALLS 99% you make some CRAZY MONEY on that when it bounces back.

**Q&A**

**Q: You retards were tricked by bots to buying NOK, there’s no short**

A: This just full on doesn’t get what the play is about. IT IS NOT A SHORT SQUEEZE. THIS IS NOT GME RINSE REPEAT. GME IS A DIFFERENT PLAY. NOK IS A VALUE PLAY. How many more ways can I say it? Not sure. How many more do I have to?

**Q: Stop taking attention away from GME you retards**

A: Nobody is saying sell your GME. Nobody is saying that. GME is too expensive for a lot of people, and GME is VERY RISKY and NOK has genuine value behind it. If the NOK play works, those people who couldn’t afford GME can still get on & get rich. If it doesn’t, they most likely still make money on a good company.

**Q: This play is impossible / crazy / it’ll never work / there are too many shares you retards**

A: This is ALMOST true. This play WAS impossible until 1/27/2021. That is why nobody has EVER tried anything like this. But it’s NOT impossible anymore. Look at this graph. Look at it. See that spike? What the fuck is that? I’ll tell you my fellow autistic space boot packin 3310 using NOKSTER.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v473xl00ghe61.png?width=2182&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf5aac455156dbadb919b80afacb5232af0a05b5

That spike was them running out of shares for half an hour. Trade was stopped until they could find more, to avoid an artificial spike in the price.

Proof? Look at the volumes. A small sale (red) causes a small dip. Two small buys cause a MASSIVE SPIKE. They ran out, and had to call their friends to liquidate more shares so the price wouldn’t skyrocket ""artificially"".

But that’s IMPOSSIBLE for NOK. NOK has 5bn shares. Nokia should be much more stable because it has so many shares, having a crazy demand spike is crazy. I saw it, and fell off my chair and since I’m such a retard it took me an hour to get back up.

So it **was** impossible, and that’s why Wall Street won’t see it coming. They think this is their attack and they’re about to break through our ranks, but they’re actually playing right into our hands.

Wendnesday, we moved 1bn shares. Thursday, when nobody could buy, we still moved 500m. Yesterday, we still moved 360m. We’ve moved so much NOK in the past three days, the average volume of the share has MORE THAN DOUBLED in THREE DAYS. The play is not impossible anymore, but Wall St thinks it is, which is how we can use their own strength and mass against them. But the value buy still makes sense WHENEVER you see someone dump a valuable share. Someone sells you a 100$ bill for 90$? Buy it.

They attack? We absorb. They dump, we buy, they run out of shares, we hold. They’re fucked, and they just handed us a bunch of value shares at an undervalue = they just gave us their money. They are just giving it to you. When they realize they can’t buy them back at a lower value, what do you think is going to happen?

**Q: We don’t do value plays, we do short squeezes you retards**

A: Go back to April. Look at u/DeepFuckingValue’s position. **GME was a value play**. It’s only in April that the Short Squeeze became possible. Look it up yourself.

Will a short squeeze also happen with NOK? It’s unlikely. Hedge Fund Assholes have been increasing their shorts in NOK in the last few days, but they won’t go over 100% on 5bn shares because they're not as stupid as me. But it doesn’t have to happen. We just need to buy the dumps. If they short, great. More money for us as long as we don’t let them drive the price down with the dumps.

**Q: Why is NOK not rocketing?**

A: Because Wall Street is dumping, just like I said they would after the Wednesday spike. That’s the whole plan. They dump, we hold the line, buy the dumps and keep the price steady.

The GME short squeeze guys waited for this for UP TO TWO YEARS. I saw it in April. I thought it was crazy. I didn’t jump in back then. If I did, I’d have about as much money as u/DeepFuckingValue. On a value share, you can afford to wait. GME was originally a value play. That’s what I should have realized in April.

SO JUST WAIT AND HOLD (if you believe and idiot like me, which you shouldn't, no need to message me about it). It’s been two days since this play even became possible.

**Q: How do we know it’s working?**

A: Look at the volume of shares traded. Nokia has 5bn shares. In the last three days, nearly 2bn have been traded. The price is still up from last week. That’s how.

This has already been a giant dumping campaign. How come the price hasn’t floored? What happens if we just buy it all up?

What happens if they run out, and then their shorts blow, the price bumps up, CNBC tells the world we broke another short wall, everyone piles on, Wall Street realizes they just gave us their shares at an undervalue and try to buy back, we don’t sell, we have all the shares? The Wednesday spike is what happens, except this time there is no stopping it. If they stop trading again and try to dump some more, you just buy up the dump and keep the spike going. Spike stops being a spike and becomes a floor.

&#x200B;

**Q: Where will this max out and when?**

A: What do you think I’m from the future? I just saw an impossible thing happen on Wednesday, and we need to make it happen again. Look at the graph. Look at it.

Set your targets to $3310, that should do it.

**Q: When should I buy? What should I buy? Should I buy?**

A: Be your own person. Buy when you feel like it, if you feel like it.

**Q: Wall street bots are promoting NOK.**

A: I don’t give a shit. If they are, and we keep buying, they are promoting giving us money.

&#x200B;

Part 2: (29 Jan)

First off, much as I appreciate the love, I can’t play your hand for you. You have to make your own decisions. Do I know where NOK is going to be tomorrow? Nope. Nobody does. All that I have for you is the news from Wednesday that this play is no longer totally impossible:

1. I think the assholes are going to try to dump you out of the market
2. It won’t work if we keep the demand up.
3. The way we keep demand up is we buy, and others will follow us because the company is good.
4. When they realize it won’t work, they’ll need to start buying back in.
5. Then it’ll be too late, cos they dumped their shares on US and we are RETARDS who HOLD. That means that when their shorts start to go bust, the price will jump up (a little bit, not like with GME at first – this is a different play based on the health of the company, not a straight up short squeeze. The short position on NOK is much smaller).
6. When the price jumps up, and the GME guys start cashing out, they need somewhere to put that cash. Some of them pay off student loans, or buy cars or whatever, but the smart ones will go NOK.

How you play it is up to you. I can’t tell you if you should buy, what minute to buy, what app to use and so on. All I can say is I buy the dumps. You need to decide for yourself if you want to do it. You can see the dumps on any app, or even yahoo finance. I buy NOK on NYSE, and I buy straight up shares (so they can’t lend out mine for shorts) but you’re free to do what you want. I’m a retard, you’re a retard, we’re all autistic fucks, we make up our own mind and stick with it.

Secondly, what I said yesterday morning would happen, did happen. And it happened exactly like I said it would. So don’t get scared off, just buy the dumps. And they know that they’ll be fucked if we keep buying the dumps. That’s why they stopped us from buying NOK.

NOK hasn’t bubbled, stopping us from buying NOK was because they know we’re on to them. They know the dumps won’t work if we JUST KEEP BUYING and HOLDING. The play works, they’re scared, we caught them with their pants down, they’re trying to get ahead of us.

OK, so about what happened yesterday with RH and others. I’m so fucking angry about this.

What RH and others did is completely insane. Their argument is “you guys are throwing your money away on a bubble, we’re just protecting you”. Bullshit. I won’t comment on GME, I’ll let u/DeepFuckingValue or one of those guys do that. I’ll just say, that short squeezes happen with hedge funds all the fucking time. Why is trading not stopped for them? They have people’s fucking pensions that they’re playing with.

But for NOK, it’s TOTAL BULLSHIT. Here’s why:

1. NOK HAS NOT BUBBLED. Look at the graph. Look at it. It is still down from 2016. NOK is well within normal variation. Long term, you barely see the spike from a couple of days ago. There is nothing to “protect us” from. They’re protecting themselves.
2. The NOK play is not a straight up short squeeze. The play is HELPED by the shorts that are there, as long as we can keep the demand up and keep the price up against the dumping, but that’s all.
3. NOK is a healthy company, with new and important tech, a great brand, a lot of potential. You want to see why, read the original post. ANYONE who sees a company like that being dumped for NO REASON would buy. So should you. They are only dumping it because they’re trying to fuck up our play.

Ok that’s enough for now. I’ll see you all when I’ve got my space boots on, in my house on the FUCKING MOON, next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA with my broke ass. If this doesn’t work, then at least you TOOK ON THE MOTHERFUCKERS and EARNED A PLACE at the table with FUCKING ODIN.

UNBREAKABLE 3310!

**ORIGINAL POST (28 Jan):**

I get it, it’s not the play. I’m not saying sell your GME. I’m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I’m a regular guy who’s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don’t agree with me, just say so.

I’m also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks.

But, BUT, yesterday we did something they’ve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That’s what that big spike was, and that’s why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it’s too late.

Impossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That’s never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world.

3516.16% of average trading volume.

Do you get it? They’ll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won’t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Why do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don’t want “artificial” spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That’s why that spike went down right after the freeze.

But then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn’t go down. The assholes who’d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who’d convinced them.

Everyone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.

What did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we’re retards (they are correct).

But how come the price didn’t go down? It’s got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?

Because the retard brigade was buying it. There’s 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that’s 300m shares.

Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets.

And normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don’t think it’s a bubble that’s going to crash on them.

So why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I’m not saying sell GME).

Because GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who’s just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.

Not so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let’s not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.

You know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why?

What else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I’m not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that’s going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade – Do you think we’re going to need more data this year than last year?

Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn’t handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?

But why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?

US and Europe can’t buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren’t afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn’t really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.

Want proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

And we’re going to send them there. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

But hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it’s so great?

Answer: because Microsoft fucked them. That’s right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who’d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now.

Worked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered.

The asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up.

So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don’t they have? Money. That’s why they’re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works.

But if we drive the share price up, do you think that’s going to change?

So FUCK IT. I’m in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I’ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

TL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.

**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question.",2021-02-02 13:00:30

Initially wrote this at the end but I think it's better at the beginning:
**Practical Applications, General Advice**
-
General pointers for the newbies. Most of the option trading shown on WSB is OTM naked calls or puts with expiration < 3 weeks (*FDs*). **These are like lotto tickets and are not considered responsible investments by anyone, including us. They are retarded and we know it. You should know it too before buying.** Theta is usually insane and probability you make money is slim. On the flip side, selling these options is sometimes considered ok but is often **referred to as picking up pennies in front of a steamroller** due to the low return for high risk. If you want to preserve your hard earned money, make responsible plays. With options that usually means **~3 months minimum expiration, and strikes somewhat close to the money, if not in the money.** Consider the implications of IV in your trades, and make sure you understand the mechanics of the options before opening spreads. 

-------------

Options Basics

An option is a contract that gives you the option to buy (**call**) or sell (**put**) 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (the **strike price**) at or before a certain date (the **expiration date**). Options are priced **per share**, so a call with a listed price of $1 will cost you $100 total for 1 contract ($1 x 100 shares). For American style options (what most of you are trading) you can exercise at any time before the strike price, while European options (which are sold for major indices on American markets) can only be exercised on the expiration date. That doesn't matter too much for our purposes but I'll get into that later (EDIT: I never elaborated. This is really only important for [box spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boxspread.asp#:~:text=A%20box%20spread%20is%20an,strike%20prices%20and%20expiration%20dates.). They aren't allowed on RH and have their [own history here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zW86yXg7RM&ab_channel=MHFIN). Don't bother with them). 

Options have both intrinsic and extrinsic value. **Intrinsic value** is what that option would be worth at expiration. For example, if you have a $60 call in gamestop, and gamestop stock is at $65, your intrinsic value is $65-$60 = $5 (the difference your strike price vs what price you can sell it on the open market). An option will only have intrinsic value if it is **in the money (ITM)**, which means price is above strike for calls and below strike for puts. **Extrinsic value** is the time value of the option, and will vary based on the **implied volatility (IV)** of the option. The definition of implied volatility is complicated and tends towards circular logic if you apply it practically, but generally it can be thought of as how much options traders expect the underlying to move. If the stock moves a lot, IV goes up. If there's a big event, like an earnings report, IV goes up. If that earnings report passes, or the stock stabilizes, IV goes down. IV varies greatly depending from one stock to another and can change drastically depending on numerous circumstances, but as a generalization anything < 30% IV could be considered low and anything > 100% IV could be considered high. **Out of the money** options (price below strike for calls and above strike for puts), have value that is entirely extrinsic- for that reason they tend to have larger percent moves than ITM options. 


Greeks 

The greeks can be an intimidating topic but are extremely important if you want to trade spreads (more on this later) and I would argue anyone buying options should have a basic understanding of the greeks. This will be geared towards average/wsb investors, I'm not going to get into the other greeks here because they usually aren't as important for our purposes.

**Delta**: How much the option price will move relative to moves in the the share price. Positive for calls and negative for puts. It ranges 0-1, delta of 1 is equivalent to holding 100 shares, delta 0.5 is equivalent of holding 50 shares. Simple enough. This will increase as you are in the money and decrease if you are out of the money. An at the money option will typically have 0.5 delta, a far ITM option will have delta close to 1.

**Theta**: How much time value the option will lose per day. This is >0 (technically <0 if you are short, more on this later). A theta of 0.1 means the value of the option will lose $0.10/share/day, or $10/day. Theta increases as the expiration date becomes closer, so an option expiring this week will lose more money/day than one expiring next month (given same strike). For options of the same expirations, it will typically highest at the money and decreases as you move further ITM or OTM. [EDIT: Corrected]

**Gamma**: Rate of change of delta. This represents how much delta will change as the stock price moves. This is highest for near the money options and lowest for far ITM or far OTM options. 

**Vega**: Change in option price relative to on change in IV. High vega means the price moves a lot with changes in IV. This will increase with the amount of time left on the contract (more time = higher vega) and is typically highest at the money strikes and lowest for far ITM or OTM strikes. 

Buying/Selling Options

Just like stocks you can buy or sell individual contracts. You can also create positions that combine both long and short options, these are known as spreads. Individual contracts are fairly easy to understand and trade, though they typically come with higher risk and higher reward than their spread counterparts. 

**Long vs Short:** You can buy or sell options. Buyers can sell or exercise their contracts to close the position. Buyers need the stock price to move for their position to profit. Shorts can buy to close or wait for the option to expire. They will profit if the price stays the same (from theta) or moves in their favor. Increases in IV will help longs and hurt shorts, decreases in IV will hurt longs and help shorts.

**Calls:** Bulls buy calls. Their maximum loss is the initial cost of the call, their max profit is uncapped. They lose theta. Bears can sell calls (**naked calls**), their maximum loss is unlimited and their max profit is the initial price of the call. They gain theta.

**Puts:** Bears buy puts. Their max loss is the initial price of their put, their max profit is the strike price (stock can't go lower than zero), they lose theta. Bulls can sell puts (**naked puts**), their maximum loss is the strike price of the contract (stock price can't go below zero) minus the initial cost of the contract, their max profit is the initial price of the put. 

**Spreads:** Combination of a buy and a sell. These come in all different forms and allow all sorts of strategies that are impossible with shares or naked positions. In general there are **credit spreads** which is when you sell the spread and receive money up front, and **debit spreads**, which you buy the spread pay up front. When constructing spreads it's useful to know that the resulting greeks will be the sum of the greeks from all the contracts in the spread. So if you buy a call with delta 0.5 and sell a call with delta 0.25, your overall delta is 0.5-0.25=0.25. I'm only going to cover a few here because I'm getting tired but just know there are a ton of options trading strategies out there.

**Vertical Spread:** Buy and sell different strikes at the same expiration. For example, if I'm bullish on GME I can buy $60 calls and sell $65 calls for 1/29 (debit spread). The cost of the $60 call is offset by the $65, but the profit is capped at $5 per contract. Theta is lower (and can be negative) although delta and gamma are also lower. It's important to note that when the position is ITM, the overall spread price will be less than the intrinsic value of the spread due to the extrinsic value of the short leg (until you're insanely far ITM). For example, that $60-65 vertical spread will be worth <$5 even if GME is $75. The price of the spread will approach its intrinsic value as the remaining time on the contract approaches 0. I can also sell a vertical spread (credit spread), I will receive the difference in value of the two contracts and will need cash collateral to cover the difference between the strikes. For example, I can sell a $65 put and buy a $60 put. Since the $65 put is worth more I receive a credit (lets say $200), then I also need to put up $300 in additional collateral. If GME goes above $65 I can wait for the contract to expire useless or buy it back for cheaper than I sold it. If it goes below $65 my loses are offset by the $200 credit. If it goes below $60 my losses are capped at $300 by my long put (I buy shares at 65, sell at 60) and initial credit received.

**Iron condor:** Combination of two OTM vertical spreads, typically of the same width. Most people trade these short, the nice thing about that is your collateral can be shared between the call and put side, because there is no way for both sides to be ITM at the same time. If you're short you make money if stock price stays the same or if volatility goes down (basically the same thing). 

**Horizontal spreads:** Buy and sell the same strike at different expirations. AKA calendar spreads. Most useful for betting on changes in volatility. A long calendar spread (sell close expiration buy long) will be long volatility, a short calendar spread (buy close expiration sell long) is short volatility. You can also use this strategy for earnings plays, when you know the short dated options will lose more volatility than long dated options. These are most valuable near the money and will lose value as they go farther ITM or OTM. For this reason some traders will incorporate both OTM puts and calls into these positions. Calls are delta neutral at the money, slightly delta positive OTM, and slightly delta negative ITM (reverse for puts). 


That's all I have the energy for. Feel free to ask questions. Good luck out there.

First, let’s talk about fish. What do they do before they die? They jump around; they try to escape; they make noises. If your hands are weak, you let the fish escape. Now you cannot feed your family because your hands are just made of paper.

I know you are scared, me too. Especially when we thought we lost our guidance today after trading hours and we saw the price dropped without an ability to do anything. For me, I’ve just bought some more at $350 for 16k and I was scared shitless. I’m not gonna lie.

But, you should know that THEY ARE SCARED too, even more than us. You see, Melvin is nothing but just a big fish to us. This fucking shark I gotta bring it down not only to feed my family but also yours. But before we defeat them, they will use every dirty trick to fuck us over to win back this game. You will get hurt if your hands are not made of diamond. So HOLD IT tight, like you hold your wife’s boyfriend’s dong.

# WHEN TO SELL?

When you see the price goes up 5 times, 10 times, 50 times, or even more from one day to a week. That is when the short-queeze happens. That is when you sell. If your hands are made of paper, sell your position when it’s 5x. If your hands are made of wood, sell it at 10x. And so on so forth.

DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN’T HAPPEN YET. I repeat, **DO NOT SELL IT WHEN THE SQUEEZE DOESN’T HAPPEN YET**. This is a phenomenon that happens only ONCE in your life. You don’t want to miss it.

TL;DR: Only sell when you see the price spikes up 5x, 10x, 100x from one day to a week. This is the way.

GME will squeeze and here's the 10 reasons why I think so + rabbit-hole reading,4453,ladv7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ladv7v/gme_will_squeeze_and_heres_the_10_reasons_why_i/,271,1612241734.0,"TL:DR 💎🙌 = 🦍🚀but read anyways.

My monkey brain has been reading wsb far to long and I decided to put together a quick list of reasons why I think the squeeze will happen (or not, fuck you I lick doors), I sourced everything so that if you learn to read in the next little while you can give it a shot with those. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

A) GME has been on the NYSE Threshold Securities List for over 35 days.  The streak of FTD (Failure to deliver) of shares continues. Where are the shares?

B) The last 3 trading days have had abnormally low volume. It's not coincidental that when the sentiment for $GME is at its all time high and price mooning, trading is/was being suppressed.  Last week was an obvious attack on retail investors ability to purchase shares and gatekeeping from upward momentum. An obvious tell that they would and did incur massive losses.

C) Since then we've seen Short Ladder attacks everyday to force stop losses and paper hands in order to cover as much as they can. We saw on full display the perversion of MM's/HF's trying to fuck the average joe for their negligent behavior. We've recovered every time. This is an orchestrated attack. This could of ended long ago if they just covered.

D) Brokers no longer have shares to borrow for short sale.

E) Speculation that the shorts have been trading counterfeit shares, this isn't a unique situation and I wouldn't be surprised is this is happening. They could be trying to cover their tracks of this as well as prevent catastrophic losses.

F) The losses incurred should strengthen your convictions about the thesis of $GME.  Melvin needed to be bailed out, RH CEO lied publicly about liquidity and required a bailout today. I'm sure more will also be taking further losses in the days/weeks ahead. HOLD STRONG, they are trying to bait you through volatility, disinformation  and attrition/fatigue. We are gamers HOLD STRONG, consider this a time-gated mission before getting your legendary weapon.

G) The aggressive and blatant ramp-up of disinformation through media is immensely revealing. The billionaires are scared and getting their stooges to throw all the FUD at the wall to see what sticks, to ensure we don't hit the ""grand slam"" as Cramer put it. They are shilling silver (perfectr example), stating arrogantly that reddit is in on silver while out of GameStop ,or both (the swaggystocks sentiment tracker shows the complete opposite) and finally of course saying last week that the shorts are covering. Today's media was down right egregiously incorrect.

I) Bloomberg terminal still showing over 120% SI. However there will be a clearer update of the short interest in the coming few days. I want to say the date is Feb. 9, 2020.  IMO shorts have not covered.

J) FINALLY, THERE IS ONLY ONE GME. NOTHING ELSE REPLICATES THE CONDITIONS. I LIKE THE STOCK AND RYAN COHEN. FUNDAMENTALLY I BELIEVE GME WILL REPLICATE CHEWY.  ALWAYS HAVE A TARGET BUT I'M HOLDING. THIS IS A WAR, WE CAN REMAIN RETARDED THAN THEY CAN REMAIN SOLVENT BUT THAT STILL MEANS IT TAKES TIME. DONT BE PAPER HANDED AND STAY RESOLUTE.

I believe that these 10 factors are converging and I'm holding.

1-Even though buying seems to be back, it can change again in any moment and your orders may not fill. When the dip comes again, AND IT WILL, DO NOT SELL. You may think you can sell all your positions and buy back in on the cheap, BUT THERES NO GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO BUY BACK IN. JUST HOLD AND WE WIN. DONT BELIEVE ANY SHORT FLOAT LIES TODAY.

2-Our buying preassure is low today thanks to rh fucking us, and mainly because most of us are already holding. At this point its a game of waiting them out and NOT pussying out in their attacks.

3-Melvin fucked up with this whole situation, but these guys are NOT stupid. They have harvard mathmaticians and professional risk analysts. They probably figured out that their losses will be marginally LESS for holding their positions open and paying the borrowing fees than it would be if they covered now. They want to wear us down over time by blocking us from buying, sniping stop losses with ladders and constant media attacks like that sellout Cramer saying the squeeze is over. ALL we have to do is hold, and we will win. If you keep selling, they can slowly cover over time while keeping the price steady.

**Reasons you might want to disable your share lending settings include:**

1. You don't want to lend your shares to people trying to short your stocks
2. You think the person/entity loaning your stock may not return them
3. You're not being compensated well enough (or at all) for putting your stocks at risk

These programs are complex and highly variable depending on your broker. Without getting into all the details now just now, you should be aware of the most common types of lending:

* Brokers reserve the right to lend out securities **bought on margin** (in other words, with borrowed money from your broker). **To avoid this type of lending, don't buy stocks on margin.** As far as I know, this is the case for all brokers that offer margin accounts. (However if you have explicit confirmation to the contrary from your broker, feel free to provide it here!)
* Most brokers can ALSO lend out your fully-owned shares. Brokers will do one of the following:

1. Lend out **fully-owned** shares purely based on the **type of account** or level of trading permissions you have (e.g., Margin account type). The only solution in this case is switching account and/or trading permission types. Example: Degiro
2. Lend out **fully-owned** shares **regardless of account type** (even Cash accounts).
   1. Some brokers **allow you to opt-out**. Example: Webull
   2. Some brokers **do not allow you to opt-out**. Your only recourse to avoid lending is switching brokers. Example: M1 finance
3. Lend out **fully-owned** shares in a Margin account, and giving you a **portion of the profits**.
4. Some combination of the above, with option #3 becoming available at a certain account NAV. Example: Fidelity
5. None of the above (i.e. no lending - less common) Example: TDA, Vanguard

So yeah, every broker does it differently. The numbered scenarios here are referenced in the table above. The table only addresses **fully-owned share lending**, because the ability for your broker to lend your shares bought on margin is (as far as I know) the same with all brokers.",2021-01-22 13:55:32

Due to your actions last week you forced many of us to make a decision of what platforms we will be using to trade from in the future. I personally moved all of my funds from RH to another platform. What you may not realize is that there are a LOT of people who did this as well. All of my funds will become available to trade with on Monday morning as I'm sure many other peoples will be too. 

You fucked yourself and your friends... as come Monday morning will be a whole lot more capital ready to be reivested in GME, AMC, NOK, BB and what ever the fuck other stocks I LIKE.

I LIKE THIS STOCK, I LIKE THIS COMPANY, I LOVE RYAN COHEN and FUCKING LOVE MY FELLOW RETARDS. We are not just lowly elite, we are the SUPER ELITE.

Can't Stop, Won't Stop, GameSTONK!

Edit 2: It seems some people are still asking if its too late to buy. I value this stock at $4206.90 and that's what I'm willing to walk away with. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. With that being said... a life with out taking risks is a life having to wear a condom EVERY FUCKING TIME while you continually pound Melvin's Ass.

Edit 3: Next step.... we reached 320 this week and that was our target. Congrats all my fellow degenerates as we held the line. As you can see they are now offering up to 800 on next week's options. That's our next target. The squeeze could happen or it may not happen next week but we have a target in sight. They are trying to do everything in their power to suppress our valuation. Hold strong autists. We set the price. Prediction: GME opens Monday 500+ and we continue on our mission.

Edit 4: A lot of people are asking me questions about what happened. I was trading GME since Jan 11th as a broke ass bitch, I threw in $200 played a nice $26 call before we spiked to 32 I was excited and cashed out to turn that into 30 shares of GME and hedged my way up to 55 shares over the following weeks. Im not rich, I think I just played this right move.
Now here's what happened on Thursday... The Robinhood app blocked me from buying so my plan was to do a hedge on multiple platforms. Sell half on RH and rebuy after the inevitable ladder attack on my Webull account and then transfer my money there as well from RH. When I sold on RH they literally sold ALL of my shares not just my available shares since the others were locked up in limit sells. I panicked after that happened. And bought in as many as I could on my low funded Webull account. So I had to essentially sit out for the day. Friday full RH transfer hit my account and I set up a new account.
Atleast I sold at around 380 and was able to buy back in below that. I owe about 70k in medical debt and GME gave me a chance at making up some of that, I'm +25k on a $200 investment, I need this. You need this. We all need this.

Edit 5: now I'm hearing a lot about people talking about possibly missing the short squeeze if they transfer. In all honestly do you fucking care at this point? I don't. I'm all in and have literally put every dime I possiy could on GME I don't really give a shit about it. We are making these cunts bleed out. And if something at some point hits my sell limit I'll be happy, but if it doesn't I don't care because I KNOW THAT I DID THE RIGHT THING.",2021-01-30 14:17:07
Almost 75% of all retail $GME orders were to buy (Fidelity). DONT BUY INTO THE FUD 🚀,3877,lajjs2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lajjs2/almost_75_of_all_retail_gme_orders_were_to_buy/,108,1612256697.0,"**FINAL EDIT**: There are critical support levels of retail buying points. Those are 143 (which was unbroken at the tie of writing), 68, and 38. 68 (8:10 - 8:25 AM today, Feb. 4 '21) has clearly broken as people closed off positions at breakeven and the flood gates down burst open. Another sell off between 10:00 & 10:15 AM coincided with another sell wall at 64-62. I think we'll make it all the way to 30-40 before it'll make sense to start buying long again (you saw what happened at 64-68; the same will likely happen at 34-38 but I don't know where the exact floor is).

The data has been showing, since the 140s, that retail isn't holding. ***The data presented as the cornerstone and namesake of this DD is no longer relevant***. The ratio of volume of shares per sell order relative to buy order appears to be higher than the ratio of buy orders to sell orders. In other words, there may be a 3:1 distribution of raw orders, but the sells are so much more packed that it breaks the ratio anyway. *The situation changed and as more data came to light, I now know I was wrong.*

*I used to be a HODLer* ***until the situation changed***. I lost out on a lot of profit by holding through waning evidence at the 300s, 200s, and 150s, and only pulled at 111—I was able to secure a little bit of profit to make this obsession a bit more worthwhile. At time of writing, the price is 52.60. Even with bullish conviction, this was still a directionally correct move as I can now buy double as much as I had before.

That being said, I think we're in for more downside, and I will not be buying back until we hit the bottom, wherever that may be. ***I'm still long-term bullish on the company transformation and will re-enter a moderately sized position after the volatility settles down.***

**Here's the original DD so you can see how I had brought up good data, but was directionally incorrect in my sprinkled analysis of it. Learn from this like I did, and you'll be more successful in the future.** Furthermore, I will not stop writing DDs because I think the data here is sound and makes sense. What was wrong was the analysis, which can happen to anyone with this many unknown variables. Future DD will take confirmation bias into account and will have higher probability of being on the money.

Today's most traded retail assets on Fidelity were $AMC & $GME.

And you know what people did? They bought a metric fuckton of shares. Contrary to what some of the Reddit Daily thread sentiment (which may or may not be bot-infested hell at this point) & news outlets claim, retail has seemingly not lost any interest in the stock and possibly prevented it from diving further.

Obligatory disclaimer: Mods, for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and I know for a fact it hasn't been discussed sufficiently / didn't get a dedicated post yet. Also, I'm a 🦍 and am not financial advisor and this isn't financial advice. This is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake.

Disclaimer 2: I am extremely long $GME 🚀🌙

**UPDATE**: my stop loss got triggered and I am no longer long $GME until data changes. The information here has not changed, but the impact and its magnitude may have.

With that out of the way, I present to you,

# Exhibit A: Order Distribution

\~***75%*** of all $GME orders on Fidelity *today, on 2/1* were to *buy* the asset, rather than sell it. Each order can have however many shares.

[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

That's just Fidelity. If you're able to check the order distribution on other brokers (like Vanguard or Schwab) please post it below and I'll update this post with your info. Usually this information is displayed on Top Traded Stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab.

There's more:

WeBull is showing a 45/55 distribution on the entire order book. Total Outflow (sells) was quoted at 1099, and total inflow at 996. While this may seem useless at first, consider this: the share price lost ***30***% today, but the order book is split ***45/55***, not ***35/65***. Just 10% of the outflow accounted for the 30% collapse in share price.

# Exhibit B: Volume

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/)

Today's volume was half of the daily average. *Half of the daily average*. And while the price 30% movement may seem scary at first, trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign. Courtesy of u/weedcomet:

""[https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html](https://finance.zacks.com/importance-price-changes-previous-day-stock-market-2906.html) 'After a strong-volume upward move, if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row, it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise.'""

In other words, flat or even *declining* on low volume often precedes 🚀 🚀 🌝. Literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude.

There's also been studies done on this phenomena, and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price. Feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read.

# Exhibit C: Why Retail Buying May Return Soon

I'm not a financial advisor, and even less so Nostradamus. I don't know when we'll be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit. What I do know is that that time is approaching. Considering two major events:

1. Transition from Robinhood & other affected brokers to mainstream solutions• This was likely started en masse on Thursday, before RH transfer restrictions kicked in. It takes 2-5 market days to transfer an account to another broker, and about the same for just slushing cash around. That means, a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week.• Many are also in the process of opening up new accounts. These were probably started en masse on Friday, when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge. A solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits.- The instant deposits are capped, meaning whale accounts aren't able to kick in yet. Regular deposits takes 1-2 business days to clear. Beginning tomorrow, we'll start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta.
2. Robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week. Robinhood just raised another $2.4 billion on top of their previous round, which is more than enough to clear DTC's collateral requirements. According to their own statements as of late, this was the primary reason why Robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place. If you're willing to trust them on that, it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining Robinhood users in the coming days.

# Conclusions

Putting 1+2+3 together we get a potential recipe for another green EoW. Retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume ass-ripping activities. HOWEVER, it is by NO MEANS guaranteed, and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days. Get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week / beginning of next.

GME to moon.

**ANOTHER EDIT:** Welcome to the end of the post. I’m proud of you for making it this far in literacy class. I want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them. I’ll answer them as soon as they show up.

**UPDATE:** Ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is WRONG. Also some FAQs that got blocked. The questions were valid so here’s the best I could do:

1–Retail made no dent so what to expect now?

* I don’t know what to expect. What I do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in Exhibit C above.

2–Should I buy now or what?

* I want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence, not seek confirmation bias. I don’t want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else.

3–Smart money is leaving and you’ll be left holding the bag

* I have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume, SEC reports, or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of GameStop that indicates they’re leaving. If you have this information please relay it to me (don’t use comments, you’ll get blocked by bot). BlackRock had to adjust due to internal requirements AFAIK correct me if I’m wrong
* **UPDATE**: this post shows that more instutitional shares flowed out than in. But, more funds bought in than exited. Make of that what you will.

4–AMC?

* I have no data on AMC. You should do your own research and make a thread like this.

5–When selling then?

* I have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should. I don’t have the financial capability to let GME go to 0. I’ll keep a small position post-exit just in case. Make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach. Don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose. Nothing on this sub is financial advice. You don’t have to sell if you can lose everything. I’m probably liquidating my options and doing shares only until further trend confirmation.",2021-02-02 02:04:57
"Preparing for the possibility of a 1/29 squeeze - the importance of a solid sell wall, holding the line, and avoiding prisoners' dilemma cascading sell offs.",3597,l7apfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7apfk/preparing_for_the_possibility_of_a_129_squeeze/,372,1611901172.0,"Alright boys and girls we've made it to a pretty critical stage here. Tomorrow we face the possibility of a massive squeeze fueled by short coverage and the inevitable gamma squeeze that will come from thousands of call contracts being exercised. Some things to note - MMs buy 95% of the underlying shares represented by call contracts to hedge each time they're bought; as we've seen in the past few days, in this case MMs are almost the same 'group' as the shorts. This throws a wrench in things that I don't know how to interpret. Anyone? They worked together today to lock us out, tank the price, and make a 100 million dollar short sale while liquidating massive share quantities at a price so low it margin called anyone holding that many shares on margin in the first place. We can expect buy lockouts and other bullshit but the gamma squeeze remains **inevitable**. The gamma squeeze will not necessarily lead to or indicate the short squeeze happening, no one knows. It seems like the most important thing each investor has to prepare for on their own is an exit strategy for call contracts expiring tomorrow (regardless of squeeze height) and shares (in the case of the actual squeeze happening) if that investor wants to sell.

As has been explained here a few times now, shorts need our shares - period. Tomorrow they will buy shares and they will buy contracts to convert into shares. They must meet the prices we set - again, period. Hypothetically, if every single person that is HOLDING shares set the sell limit to 10K (which RH now prevents as an 'aggressive' limit), then shorts would have no option but to pay that price if they want to cover OR - and this is important - they CAN WAIT FOR HOLDERS TO DEFECT AND SELL EARLY, UNDERCUTTING THE SELL WALL. The **prisoners' dilemma** describes the problem of achieving maximal collective outcomes in situations where individual self-interest comes into play. In the event of a squeeze, all holders will be faced with the question of when to sell. Even if a sell wall was established by 95% of holders at 1K, if 5% of holders create sell orders at 500, the shorts will purchase all of those, and then someone holding at 1K (in the original 95%) says 'fuck, I don't want to miss out' and lowers their price to 600. Let's say 5% of that group holding at 1K does that. Now 90% of the holders are still at 1K but 10% of all shares have now been sold at or below 600. This would cascade and bring the price down.

We are NOT a hedge fund or a hive mind and there is no way to ensure we all sell at the same time and I am not telling anybody when to sell. This is all entirely hypothetical. I'm not encouraging a specific price point 🤷‍♂️ I'm merely describing a predicament we face - a market phenomenon, perhaps. Right now if you look at the GME order book, the sell 'wall' looks like a staircase, moving upwards at a pretty natural slope. That kind of sell wall will not produce the optimal collective outcome in terms of sale price in the case of a squeeze. In that scenario, the actual sale prices would likely never reach the top. What **would** produce the optimal group outcome is a true sell wall, where limit orders are **FLAT** until a **massive Kingdom of the Fucking North Wall** at a single price. Thoughts? I personally just love the fucking stock. Play with the bull you get the fucking horns.

EDIT: [https://imgur.com/gallery/wLMohne](https://imgur.com/gallery/wLMohne) this is the current sell staircase versus a sell wall. NONE of this post is financial advice. I'm just a retard drawing in my notes app.

Important enough for its own post: Robinhood was NOT the only one that banned GME and should NOT be the only one to get legal scrutiny thrown at them! List all culprits here.,2948,l7fz4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fz4q/important_enough_for_its_own_post_robinhood_was/,514,1611914490.0,"Go look at posts/comments from earlier today from dudes wondering where the hell to buy GME because their non-RH broker of choice ALSO banned purchasing GME. GME dropped over 75% from its high not because just RH did this, and we all know it.

MOST BROKERS DID THIS. MOST OF THEM.

Now - go look at the front page of Reddit, the front page of your favorite news source, and the tweets of your favorite politicians. 95% of mentions of these shenanigans mention ONLY RH.

Why's that? Hell, you KNOW why deep down, but let's spell it out.

These prominent people - politicians, celebs, rich people, etc. - who are suddenly on your side would **love** to see **only RH** bite the dust. RH already had been disrupting the industry and taking business away from the established brokers who were charging ridiculous fees from back when you had to hop on the phone and call a broker to perform trades.

The second RH goes away, and other newer ones like WeBull get similarly targeted and scrutinized, what'll happen? Return of the $8+ per trade $1 per contract BS as the norm. Fees that go down with the more money spent, because brokers loooove rich people, and hate us and want to rake as much as they can from us.

Should RH get reamed? Absolutely. Should all the other brokers that pulled these shenanigans get reamed too? You betcha. And right now, that's clearly not going to happen. I've not seen a single politician, including AOC, mention ANY broker other than RH. Hell, a congressperson drafted a fucking letter about troubling/concerning yada yada about RobinHood. Only RobinHood. **Again, MOST BROKERS did this.**

Frankly, ANY broker that pulled this shit should be shut the fuck down. If not by the law, by their customers getting the fuck away from their thieving asses.

So, did your broker do this to you too? List 'em here. Hell, make a separate post about them. Upvote all of them. Let's not let them get away with this. They're trying to sneak out of a war they started and present RH as the lone culprit and make you feel warm and happy about class action lawsuits that'll get you a baconator in about 5 years. Don't let them.

It's clear the media and politicians all intend for those other brokers to get away with it. The ONLY way they won't is for us to plaster their names everywhere and make it IMPOSSIBLE to ignore.",2021-01-29 03:01:30
***Official Class Action Lawsuit***,2862,l70y4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l70y4v/official_class_action_lawsuit/,445,1611879232.0,"As of this morning I have contacted a lawyer to proceed with an official class action lawsuit against Robinhood Financial LLC. Please make this known and be on the lookout for a future update on details on how to join. We cannot allow them to get away with this unscathed. This is NOT a free market.

Edit 1 - Small update on actions taken so far:

1. Messaged Robinhood first asking them to stop. No response, obviously.
2. Filed an official complaint with the SEC. No response as of yet.
3. Called an attorney who specializes in class action lawsuits. Left a voicemail with him. Also called his paralegal who I also had to leave a message with.

Edit 2 - Heard back from my lawyer, we should have something officially filed by noon today. I don't know if the chance to sign on comes then or a while after but I'll let you all know.

Just so everyone knows, I'm also including \*several other stocks and trading platforms\* in this if I can. Not sure if they'll get lumped in the same lawsuit or broken into subs. Just know that we hear you and will include you. 

You are being heard. Don't give up.

Edit 3 - Removed other trading platform names.

Edit 4 - I've been informed that, if the lawsuit picks up, it will likely be consolidated to the location Robinhood does business (California, USA). I mentioned to my lawyer that this has become a global issue as evidence by those outside the USA commenting below. I'm currently concerned that I may not be able to include these areas in the suit and encourage you to file your own complaints as well. I'll keep pushing the issue, just wanted to let you all know.

Edit 5- Thank you all for your attention and participation. Also, a special thanks to those asking to donate to the cause, but I have been informed that there will be no legal fees directly billed to me in regard to this suit so the only cost to me will be time, energy, and stock losses obviously. No need for donations, but I appreciate the sentiment.

Edit 6- Looks like we're playing a waiting game at this point. The suit was filed earlier this morning but due to the insane amount of other suits being filed for the same thing, this will probably end up getting eaten up by one of the other higher profile versions. That said, don't stop fighting, record all evidence, and make sure they can't get away with this.

Many people have messaged me with additional stocks and platforms affected, I see them, there are just too many to add to this post at the time. The lawyer will get all the evidence regardless. I'm told that it could be quite some time before anything comes to fruition here so I apologize to anyone and everyone waiting in agony as I am.

Edit 7\*\*\*IMPORTANT\*\*\* The support for this is completely amazing, thank you all very much. That said, it has come to my attention that many people would like to donate financially to this cause to keep it moving. I cannot stress this enough... PLEASE DO NOT GIVE ANYONE MONEY REGARDING THIS OR ANY OTHER CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. I'm getting concerned that some people might use this as an opportunity to crowd fund a large sum of money. That is NOT what this is about. The lawyer I'm working with specifically stated that there will be no financial cost to file a class action lawsuit like this and the only time they will make anything is upon settlement of a suit, at which point they will take a cut/commission basically. I am not asking for money to help this happen and I urge all of you to completely avoid anyone who is. Yes, doing the legwork takes time and energy, but it shouldn't be exploited for financial gain.

Edit 8 - Fixing a few things cause I can't type or read apparently. Removing details of other trading platforms (other than RH) for the time being since there's conflicting info coming in and I don't want to cause confusion.

Edit 9 - Still just waiting unfortunately. If anyone sees a different lawsuit get published just reply here and I can update with the details of that one so people can get on the train asap.

Edit 10 - ***HOW TO JOIN***
Hi Everyone! For those chomping at the bit to join, please go to https://underdoglawyer.com/ to join. In the upper right you'll see ""Join a Class Action"". Below that, place your email address, a comment that you'd like to join the Robinhood Class Action Lawsuit, then submit. Please be as detailed as possible to ensure we have all evidence available.

We're still waiting on acceptance and possible consolidation, but this is getting big (as you can imagine) so do not give up.",2021-01-28 17:13:52

We all, or most of us, knew they were going to play dirty when shit starts going south for them. Friday is close. They are shitting themselves because that's the make-or-break point most likely.

Tomorrow is going to be a bloodbath, be ready for it. You may see the price swing to stupid lows but if we don't sell there's nothing they can do about it unless try more dirty tricks. 

Be prepared for the possibility that your apps like RH may have problems paying out your tendies when its all said and done. They are all in this together.

The shorts lost $14.3 bn just in January on GME. Think about it. That's the entire GDP of a smaller country like Albania or Armenia.

Whatever happens on Friday, know that we hold all the shares they need to cover their short positions and if we don't sell they'll bleed out

"GME - EndGame Part 2: Cohen, Market Cap, Potential Investors",2340,l0czgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/,351,1611062299.0,"Hello again folks. This is an extension of my [DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) in which I shared some research on short positions, GME’s debt, and some speculation on institutional investing. Since that post, GME is up 75% and there’s been lots of good [bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyuu13/gme_margin_changes_and_their_implications/) / [bearish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) DD on the short term.

In this post, I’m going to cover 3 topics, focusing on the mid-to-long term prospects for GME: 1) Cohen, 2) GME’s market cap potential, and 3) potential investors that could continue to pile in.

**TL:DR;** You need to think about GME differently. Not as a trader. Not as an investor. You need to think like a venture capitalist. This is an **unprecedented** opportunity, and the first time I’ve gone all-in - *I’m more bullish now than when the stock was trading sub $15.* If you’re in GME you need to get in ***with conviction*** otherwise you’re going to lose by selling when it drops.

# Quick aside - my history and positions:

I’ve been a passive investor for many years. This is literally the first time I’ve taken an interest in becoming an active investor. I opened an RH account in August to start speculating on GME. My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/isn2g0/cheap_gme_calls_for_a_potential_lottery_win/) called out some cheap lottery plays that took my speculating account from $5K - $20K in 3 weeks. I’ve since posted a few times on GME, [even trying to tell you to buy the post-earnings dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9c95d/gme_earnings_thread/gf4g5vn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and added more to my active trading accounts. I’ve taken $10K -> $130K on RH and $230K -> $480K in IBKR since slowly adding to GME since September.

**UPDATE**: I have deleted my positions in this post - will explain why in my next post. I'm still holding. 

All that being said, thus far I’ve been thinking about GME as a *trade* \- trying to get in at the lowest cost I could for the maximum upside on a near-term exit, but **I’ve switched completely** into thinking of GME is a **ridiculously asymmetric investment** with massive potential in the next 2-3 year timeframe - even at $35. Even at $45, $50, $60. That’s why I added roughly 2500 shares on Friday at around $36 despite adding very cautiously when GME was below $20. I’m also completely all-in on RH with options (mostly deep ITM, a few fds) - $0 buying power left.

Grab a drink, sit down. Let me tell you why I’ve gotten more aggressive, and probably why you shouldn’t worry about what price you pay right now, as long as you’re willing to **believe and hold.**

# About Cohen (and friends)

From the [recent 8K about the board changes](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) (which you should **definitely read** if you’re putting serious money in):

*As part of the Agreement, RC Ventures has agreed to* ***customary standstill provisions***\*, which provide that from the date of the Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date that is 30 calendar days prior to the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company’s\* ***2022*** *annual meeting of stockholders and (b) the date that is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (such period, the “Standstill Period”), RC Ventures will* ***not, among other things: (i) acquire beneficial ownership in, or aggregate economic exposure to, directly or indirectly, more than 19.9%*** *of the Company’s outstanding common stock; (ii) make any proposal for consideration by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company; (iii) make any offer or proposal with respect to any extraordinary transactions; or (iv) seek, alone or in concert with others, the appointment, election or removal of any directors in opposition to any recommendation of the Board, in each case as further described in the Agreement. As part of the Agreement, the Company has permitted RC Ventures to acquire, whether in a single transaction or multiple transactions from time to time, additional shares of the Company’s common stock to the extent such acquisitions would result in RC Ventures having beneficial ownership of less than 20.0% of the outstanding shares, without triggering the restrictions that would otherwise be imposed under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), and RC Ventures has agreed that upon acquiring beneficial ownership 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, the restrictions under Section 203 of the DGCL would apply to a potential business combination with RC Ventures as an “interested stockholder” (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL).*

This is critical: **This agreement was the result of a negotiation** between Cohen and the existing board.

1. After his [activist letter calling out the board](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) and then [13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm) buy after the earnings dip rocketed the stock up from 12 -> 20, it was clear to everyone that RC was the reason GME’s stock was heading up. The GME board was afraid of a hostile takeover / losing their jobs. This agreement allowed Cohen and 2 others on the board as long as he didn’t attempt a hostile takeover.
2. Cohen wants it all. In the activist letter, he publicly said “no” to just one board seat. He then publicly bought more as soon as Sherman threatened a shelf offering to dilute him below 10%.

In addition to getting added to the board, Cohen brought along [2 execs who built Chewy with him](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html):

* Alan Attal - the previous **COO and CMO of Chewy** (2011 - 2018)
* Jim Grube - the previous **CFO of Chewy** (2015 - 2018)

He’s not fucking around folks. He wants to build another Chewy, and he’s bringing the people who helped him do it the first time to do it again.

As a result of the agreement, he’s limited to buying up to 20% of shares until 2022. **Why not 13%? Simple - Cohen wants the option to buy more.** He’s not happy with a single board seat; he’s not going to settle for simply getting added to the board; and **he’s not going to settle for 13% ownership.**

Also, remember that **Alan and Jim have 💲 to buy in** as well. I haven't seen their holdings yet. Their time is worth more than their money and they've already decided to put their time in.

## Cohen is not an exec - he’s a founder with an all-in mentality

Go read this [bloomberg Cohen interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo) to understand his mindset.

1. Cohen himself is an all-in person. Key quote:
   1. *“When I find things I have a lot of* ***conviction*** *in, I go* ***all-in***\*.”\*
   2. Cohen is a founder that has gone through the successful creation of a startup. **When you are startup founder, most of your NW is tied to equity in your company.** You are trained to have skin in the game. You’re not allowed to think you have a safety net. You give up years of your life and bet everything because you have to believe in what you’re doing. **Founders typically have 30-50% ownership of their company.**
   3. *“Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”*
2. He only sold Chewy rather taking it to IPO because of his Dad’s health. He cut his entrepreneurial career short and he’s itching to get back in.
3. Cohen sold Chewy for $3.35B, with estimates stating he personally walked away with about $600M after taxes.
4. Cohen has a lot of capital to buy more. After selling Chewy, he went all-in on Apple & WFC, which as of June was **up 40%**.
   1. *“ Cohen says his portfolio, when including dividends and a few other stock holdings, has returned more than 40% over the past 3 years, beating the market.”*
   2. Aapl **was his largest holding, and** **is up another 50% since June 5** when the Bloomberg article was published.
   3. Cohen lives in FL - with no income or capital gains for individuals, unlike other founders who live in CA which taxes all cap gains as ordinary income.
   4. I’m going to estimate *his net worth (minus his GME holdings) is around $800M-$1B.*
5. Cohen’s 9,001,000 (it’s over 9000! 🐲🏐) shares have thus far been purchased at something like an average of $12/share, for a total investment of around $110M.

So Cohen has put in $110M out of his $1B into GME. **Does that sound like he’s all-in?** Absolutely fucking not. Cohen’s **going to buy up to the max he can this year** (20%), likely by selling some other holdings prior to [cap gains tax law changes](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/guide-potential-tax-law-changes-under-biden). He can **add more next year** after the standstill period is done.

## What will lead to Cohen’s next purchase of GME

Thus far, every RC purchase has been *about sending a message*.

1. Prior to Q3 earnings, his purchases were signaling an intent to the board that he was serious about wanting to get involved. He also rubbed it in their faces that the stock price was largely appreciating because of him. From the [activist letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf):
   1. “We recognize that the Board may feel it is insulated from stockholder scrutiny after adding new directors this past spring and seeing a recent stock price uptick **(which only came on the heels of RC Ventures filing its 13D)”**  (what a *fucking burn*).
2. If there was any doubt about RC’s impact on the stock price, it was put to rest after Q3’s earnings, where the current leadership’s hubris and threat of diluting RC led to a drop of almost 30%. RC then bought the dip, shoved it in their faces, and the market GME again rocketing GME to 20 in a massive post-earnings recovery. Message sent again - “The market wants me. Let me the fuck in.”
3. Now that Cohen and the Chewy folks are on the board, he’s going to angle for CEO. He’s not looking to **advise** GME. He wants to go all-in, to run GME. *He’s holding the optionality of buying more based on the success of his attempt to take over GME through non-hostile means.*

**If you see Cohen buy more GME, he’s sending another message.** This time it’s because it’s clear to him he’s going to be CEO and wants to max his skin in the game. **If you see Cohen buy, it’s “CEO talks going well” - you fucking buy.**

# GME’s market cap potential

1. Cohen sees a [$200BN+ total addressable market cap for gaming by 2023](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf). For contrast, Chewy was playing in the pet food/supplies market, which has a total addressable market (TAM) of [under $50BN annually](https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp). **GME’s potential is at base 4x that of Chewy.** This **does not even account for the pc gaming hardware market**, which is another $[35BN](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269244/graphics-hardware-market-value-in-the-gaming-segment-since-2009/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,by%20the%20end%20of%202020.)\+.
2. Chewy’s market cap is [$44BN](https://www.google.com/search?q=chewy+market+cap&oq=chewy+market+cap&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j0i22i30l3.6432j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) on [$6BN](https://s23.q4cdn.com/610444331/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/3Q-2020-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf) of annual revenue.
3. Chewy’s Q3 quarterly income was up 45% YoY. While GME’s quarterly income was down YoY, [its e-commerce revenue was **up 257%** trouncing Chewy’s growth rate](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth).
4. GME’s Q4 early sales preview reported [**300% E-commerce growth and annual run-rate of $5BN**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results)

In other words, *even if you give GME’s physical locations no value*, GME’s ecommerce business is **growing 5x faster than Chewy** and already has 75% of online revenue.

**Summary:** Chewy is priced > 7X times its annual **total revenue**. GME is priced at .45 **its annual ecommerce revenue,** despite GME having **5-6 greater TAM** and growing its ecommerce business **5X as fast Chewy.**

What. The. Fuck.

I’ve never seen a stock more mispriced.

People talking about $100 price targets are suffering from a *fucking lack of imagination.*

Even if you *completely* discount

1. GME’s physical business
2. its rev sharing partnership with MSFT
3. its 5x faster growth and 5x TAM

and give GME the same P/S multiple that Chewy has on its ecommerce business, **that puts GME currently at a fair market cap above $35BN.** That means GME should be **at least $500/share.**

**$35/share is a fucking steal.** Who cares about the short-term dips as shorts try to weasel themselves out of their positions. The market will eventually wake up to this sleeping beast. In a year you’re not going to care if you got in at 4, 12, 20, 35, or 50. You’re going to only care if you’re in or not.

&#x200B;

# Potential Investors

An asset is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it, right? So are the potential buyers of this growing company?

Here’s a list in decreasing order of likelihood.

1. **Elon** (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar? ***Elon’s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** Elon could **buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours**. One call from fellow entrepreneur and [aspiring twitter-meme-god](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) would absolutely wreck the game.
   1. **If you are short gamestop**, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. ""Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it."" 🚀
2. **Buffett** (More likely, still improbable). I’m actually amazed that while Buffett & co were lamenting that there are no interesting stocks to invest in and moving to cash, that they absolutely missed the boat on GME while it was at its lows. It’s a complete value play right up his alley (in a business he can understand). My only hypothesis here is that the market cap is too small and he could not make a meaningful investment. Once GME grows to a more respectable market cap ($10b+) I can see Buffett stepping in and making an investment.
3. **Cohen’s connections. (Highly likely if Cohen is CEO).** This is the big one. And I mean absolutely nail in the coffin re-pricing of GME for the foreseeable future. [Go read this Harvard Business Review piece](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale) on Cohen specifically on how Cohen puts importance on raising money and the people that backed him.
   1. Look, I’ve started a startup before in the valley (unsuccessfully unfortunately). However, you don’t start a company without making a shit-ton of venture capitalist & angel investor connections. Cohen has stated that when pitching Chewy he was rejected by [over 100 investors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=4e3c77f95840). I can absolutely-fucking-guarantee you that every single one of them remembers their mistake and would not miss the opportunity to invest in Cohen again. And don’t forget all of the investors who DID invest with Cohen and reaped the benefits with Chewy. While venture capitalists don’t generally make investments in public equities, this is a **truly unique situation. Cohen is treating this like a rebirth, a new venture bootstrapped from GME’s bones.** If VCs as a firm will not invest, you can bet your ass that those individuals will throw their personal money at Cohen. **However this only happens if he’s CEO.** As soon as he’s CEO, a single long weekend trip to the valley might mean 100+ investor meetings with the strategic pitch.
      1. My biggest fear here is that VCs/PE band to take the company private at some small multiple (2-3x) and then reap the benefits while Cohen turns the company around only to re-list it to us 5 years down the road at 30X the valuation.
   2. Thus far, it’s been us retail retards vs the wall street shorts. HFs shorting this thing have the advantage in both tactics and capital. However, **if Silicon Valley money starts pouring money into this the game is over.** You cannot believe the amount of money that gets thrown into startups with 90% of it burning up into thin air. $3B market cap? That’s nothing. Folks with Silicon Valley money & risk tolerance would have no problem betting on a serial entrepreneur making something amazing out of a company that already has a customer base, revenue, distribution - all in the same business (e-commerce) the entrepreneur already proved themselves in.
4. **You, and every other retard that believes.** Look, this was my point at the beginning. You need to think like a VC here. VCs are the ultimate YOLO autists making million dollar bets and not seeing a penny of it for years. They are the ultimate 💎✋🤚. **You need to decide if you have conviction** for the long term and then buy in. 💎✋🤚 doesn’t mean selling at $100. It doesn’t means selling at $200. **It means not selling at all this year no matter the price, and at least until you learn for sure whether Cohen is the new CEO**. It means believing so hard that you 20-100X your investment in 2 years when the market wakes up to the ridiculous mispricing.
   1. Remember that if Cohen is elected CEO he can (and likely will) buy more than a 20% stake in 2022.
   2. Remember Buffett’s actual quote: [**""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/01/30/winning-in-the-market-with-the-patience-of-the-wright-brothers-and-warren-buffett/?sh=26303ec3633b)

**I’ve put every dollar I can** into shares in IBKR, minus some April calls. I hold no covered calls except for some call spreads I had in RH prior to recent bump. I have April calls because I will put more cash into GME after taxes are done, and I know much cash I have to use. Calls let me cap the price I would have to pay now.

This is personal research. **Do your own DD.**

A wiser investor than me gave the advice of ***“Don’t aim to maximise profit, minimize regret.”*** If you’re not in GME yet, ask yourself how you would truly feel if what everyone here is saying panned out to be true, and you weren’t participating.

**Update 1:** I'm still holding today, but I realized I made a pretty big mistake on the ecommerce revenue analysis. GME's 2019 e-commerce revenue was 1.35B (not 1.35B for the quarter), so divide my price target by 4 - $125/share or $8B market cap.",2021-01-19 06:18:19

110%+ institutional ownership or 110%+ short interest is NOT anything shady. What it is is incredibly bullish!,2022,le4hoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4hoh/110_institutional_ownership_or_110_short_interest/,207,1612667665.0,"People were shocked to hear ""over 100% of GME shares have been shorted"" or ""institutions own over 100% of GME shares.""

**""How is that possible?""**

It's actually quite simple, and nothing shady. All it shows is that the short interest is MASSIVELY overexposed, which makes them incredibly vulnerable as I'll outline below.

Here's the simple case:

Andy owns a share in a margin account. Andy's broker loans his share to Barry, who sells it. Andy sees the stock for sale, says ""I like this stock and that's a fair price"" and he buys the stock from Barry. (Andy doesn't know he's buying his own share, but it doesn't really matter.) Now Andy owns two shares and Barry is short one. Again, Barry borrows the share from Andy's broker, sells it, and Andy buys it again. Now Andy has 3 shares, and Barry is short 2. So compared to the original quantity, Andy holds 300% and Barry is short 200%!

These numbers are, for the purposes of the market, ""real"" shares. (This doesn't involve any counterfeiting or naked shorts at all.) If Charlie comes in offering a baller price, Andy can sell his three shares. That *may* cause the broker to recall the short shares from Barry, forcing Barry to now buy two shares at market price to cover.

[https://trib.com/business/investment/personal-finance/yes-a-stock-can-have-short-interest-over-100----heres-how/article\_497d907a-5107-5f0b-b983-2a118108a2d2.html](https://trib.com/business/investment/personal-finance/yes-a-stock-can-have-short-interest-over-100----heres-how/article_497d907a-5107-5f0b-b983-2a118108a2d2.html)

**""But don't shares let you vote in a stockholder meeting? How can one person vote three times with the same share?""**

They can't - it's important to understand that *you are generally forfeiting your voting rights on any share you hold in a margin account.* Shares that have been lent have no voting rights. The voting right belongs to whoever has bought a share and has *not* loaned it out. When you hold shares in a margin account, it may be loaned (you wouldn't know if it has or has not) and if it has been loaned you are not the holder of record.

[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortsalevotingrights.asp)

So in my example above, even though Andy has three shares, he has a maximum of one vote because he only owns one un-loaned share.

**""This is getting boring, how does all this get me tendies?""**

NOW you're asking the right fucking question! The brokers can *only* lend out shares that are in margin accounts (often brokerage accounts may have margin enabled). They *cannot* lend out shares that are in cash accounts or accounts w/o margin (at least not without your express permission.) So if we move our shares out of margin/brokerage accounts and into cash accounts, the brokers will run low on shares to lend.

At first, if just a small number of us move to cash accounts, the effect will be subtle (but still meaningful): as the broker runs low on shares to lend, the interest rate they charge to the shorts will increase. This puts pressure on the shorts to close sooner, since their nightly interest payment increases and so they have more incentive to close their position sooner.

Now, if we ALL do this, the effect increases nonlinearly: WE COULD ACTUALLY DRIVE ANOTHER SQUEEZE. Once your broker runs out of unlent shares (which is quite likely since the short interest is so high), if you transfer your stocks from your brokerage account to a cash account, your broker will need to recall those shares, forcing the shorts to buy! And that becomes a double-whammy to all other shorts: (1) the more shorts are forced to buy by the brokers, the higher the price goes, and (2) the lower the supply of shares available to loan is, the higher the interest rate goes. The interest payment is due nightly and is based on \[current stock price\]x\[current interest price\] and this strategy drives both factors higher, ballooning the interest payment, which pressures more shorts to close... which drives the price up more, which further pressures shorts to close... i.e. a squeeze.

(I think in the past week the brokers already did run out of shares to lend, but I can't find the citation, please post in the comments if you have intel about shares available for loan or interest %s.)

**""Wait, isn't this the exact strategy that Mark Cuban told us we should use if we want a squeeze?""**

Yes, specifically his words were *""Now if #WSB did this en masse, it would be the mother of all short squeezes.""*

[https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1355170846931886080](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1355170846931886080)

**""Isn't this the part where you tell me what to do and I do it?""**

Yes.

1. Open a cash account, or confirm your brokerage account has margin disabled. All new GME shares you buy, buy from this account and not your old margin account.
2. Try to transfer your shares from your margin account to a cash account. AFAIK they are not actually obligated to do this, they are only obligated to locate shares when you sell, but it's worth trying. We can give good PR to the brokerages that make it easy to transfer shares, and bad reviews for brokerages that block it.
3. If you have extra cash (and if you don't have extra cash and you're here now, may god have mercy on your retard soul) you can set up a cash account, then attempt to simultaneously buy shares in the cash account and sell them in the margin account for the same price. If you can do both transactions at the exact same price, this is identical to #2 where you're doing an in-kind transfer between accounts. The obvious risk here is that you can't control the price so you may lose money if you buy higher than you sell (but on the flip side may accidentally make money if you buy slightly low and sell slightly high).
4. Continue spreading the word - this strategy is nonlinear and is more effective the more shares we can remove from margin accounts. If just a few people do it it is still marginally effective, but if everyone does it we are looking at another squeeze.

edit: u/rozhasi says ""Both TD Ameritrade and Fidelity told me that if you remove the 'margin' feature from your current account, they can’t lend your shares to short sellers.""

edit2: Robinhood automatically has margin enabled, so we do not want to be using RH AT ALL anymore. Users report that after transferring from RH to Fidelity the Fidelity account automatically had margin enabled (even though *new* Fidelity accounts default to margin-disabled.) *If anyone has experience (A) transferring RH shares to a non-margin account, or (B) disabling margin on an account that RH shares have been transferred into, please post in the comments and I will try and add a how-to here.*

edit3: from u/A1pha101:  for all you Nords, Nordnet Investing Account Zero has share lending **on by default**, but there is a form you can fill out to disable it. I can't vet the link they sent to the form (it's in Norwegian hosted on [scrive.com](https://scrive.com)) so I'm hesitant to share it, but more info can be found here:  [https://www.nordnet.no/blogg/ekstra-inntekt-pa-utlan-av-aksjer/](https://www.nordnet.no/blogg/ekstra-inntekt-pa-utlan-av-aksjer/) .

However, 4 of those 5, the class  lead is a Plaintiff that didn't own shares of the affected stocks and  were people who were forbidden from buying them.  They essentially  boiled down to a person searching for a stock, not being able to find  it, and claiming damages from that.  Only one of the 5 - the one filed  in the 10th Circuit, District of Colorado - is led by a Plaintiff who  was actually IN these equities, sold some shares after the restriction  occurred, and has actual tangible damages as a result of the trading  platforms.  As a result of this and the fact that this is the only one  that is suing more than just Robinhood (it's also going after all the  major trading platforms, Apex and Citadel), it's highly likely that this  particular one is the one all the other class actions are going to get  rolled into, even though the New York one was filed first.  It's also  the only one of the 5 led by a firm that specializes in class action.

I've  been in contact with the lead in this case (I'm backing it, in fact), and the firm is looking for  all other people who have demonstrable losses and damages as a result  of RH, TDA, Schwab et al's actions as they compile their opening salvo.

THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.**

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

**TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.**

150 - 250 for GME is the sweet spot for hedges. Lowering the price risks VOLUME jumps.

I'm not going to repeat all the excellent DD you can already read on the front page. I however will bring up some important thoughts about the publics' spending habits. Buying shares above $150 a share is very expensive for Joe America, average citizen who doesn't do a lot of investments. I have been floored by the number of people willing to spend their real hard-earned money on this movement so far. Congrats to you for keeping all of us afloat. 

We have all seen that VOLUME is very important for keeping GME share price up but volume is not necessary for the ladder attacks to drop the price down. So why haven't they run the price into the ground yet? Because they risk volume jumps. The moment this stock drops below $100/share dramatically increases its affordability. The cheaper it gets the more people will be able to justify adding more to their portfolios. This is exactly what the hedges don't want. They are already in a share shortage. The last thing they want to do is drop the price of GME so low that it causes a massive buying spree. 

So how do they fix this? They do it with FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt). They want the world to think the money train has left the station and all that is left is free fall. They want to crush everyone's spirit so that when it comes time to ground that price, no one will want to buy it. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN. We need to keep our heads high and TRUST that the short positions have not been resolved. We need to TRUST that the Hedges still have a ton of debt obligations that need to be rectified. Any time we see the share price dip below $100 I suggest buying every share you can get your hands on. I know I will. They will be testing the waters over the next few weeks just to see how much enthusiasm is left for this stock. The rollercoaster will get worse. and seeing red for days/weeks is a test of our collective willpower. 

DO NOT SELL WHEN IT JUMPS TO 800. Do not think this is some lucky fluke and to get out while the getting is good. This is WHAT THEY WANT. They want to crush you so that when they give you crumbs you jump on the chance to show some return.

Some of you may have read (or seen because you cannot read) my post yesterday about a Gamma squeeze today.

&#x200B;

**BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN LIEUTENANT** u/Brassmonkeynutzz?

&#x200B;

Ok. Let's start with the basics for all of you who are wet behind the ears. What is a Gamma squeeze you ask? A Gamma squeeze occurs when option sellers/market makers buy shares of the underlying stock to hedge their positions/prepare for the possibility that call option buyers decide to exercise their right to buy. This type of hedge is necessary when a significant amount of call option strikes are expiring in the money (last week all available strikes expired in the money on a stock for the first time in financial history and this week a shit load of strikes expired in the money as well).

&#x200B;

Wait, you aren't actually reading this are you? If you are, I appreciate you. For those of you who cannot read (all of you), please see the TL;CR at the bottom of this post. (Hint: 🚀)

&#x200B;

Anyways, you might be wondering, why would Robinhood risk its reputation and entire business by limiting its customers ability to buy? Simple: ""Robinhood’s regulatory filings show the company charges large investment firms called “market makers” (👿CITADEL/MELVIN) fees to access real-time information about which stocks its users are buying and selling, a practice some regulators and industry watchers have seen as a potential conflict of interest."" In fact, ""Robinhood routes more than half of its customer orders to Citadel, by far its largest market-making partner by volume, Robinhood disclosures show."" ([source](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/robinhood-and-citadels-relationship-comes-into-focus-as-washington-vows-to-examine-stock-market-moves/ar-BB1ddG06))

&#x200B;

In other words, Robinhood is more concerned about saving the GAY BEARS 🌈🐻 that they are in bed with (their real customers - 👿CITADEL/MELVIN) than servicing retail investors like us. Ironically, Robinhood is taking from the poor and giving to the rich—it is ass backwards.

([Great post talking about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8539h/cnbc_now_running_ads_promoting_that_melvin/)) I mean seriously, ask yourselves, why the fuck would CNBC run paid advertisements about the shorts closing their positions? BECAUSE THE BIG BOYS WANT YOU TO THINK THE SQUEEZE IS OVER SO YOU SELL AND GIVE UP. FEAR NOT; THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZEN!

&#x200B;

**Think about it:** if Melvin closed its short position, it would simply move on to the next trade and never look back. There would not be any reason to ***pay*** to advertise that.

&#x200B;

**Summary:** the big dogs want you to think the squeeze is over, and they want you to panic and sell your shares. DO...NOT...DO...IT! Instead, **HOLD! BUY THE DIP! REPEAT!**

"(GME DD) Empire Strikes Back, or why you should still trust DFV.",1368,lb6g5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6g5y/gme_dd_empire_strikes_back_or_why_you_should/,163,1612328830.0,"## Market Close, and all the attacks so far.

This has been a rough week so far. GME is closing at around 90, and either you are seeing massive losses, or the unrealized gains you had evaporate right in front of your eyes. The media is spewing out 200 articles per day saying 'Gamestop is over', and that anyone who stays in the stock is retarded.

But it's simple. As Mark Cuban himself said,  

>If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.  
>  
>Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of.

And ask yourself, **what WSB is really made of?** Is it just plain autistic and retarded traders? Yes, but we also have our Diamond community. People that are actively trying to beat the market, that do their due diligence, and that want to bathe in chicken tendies.

And we have seen post after post of their DD, reinforcing over and over what we were always here for.   
And let me tell you: **Nothing has changed.**

# The short term plan (SHORT SQUEEZE)

Alright, I'll bust out the numbers quick:   
[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote™](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote™) says that the Short Interest is stil  61,780,000 shares, or 120%. The shorters have obviously refilled their shorts, knowing that their **market manipulation has driven the price down wonders.**

**Their greatest hope** to **avoid** the *Squozening* is to scare off everyone who is holding. They won't stop dumping the stock using everything they have to keep the price away from execution princes, and **avoid getting gamma squeezed again.**

**But,** this doesn't change that 120% of short interest is still insane. They have RELOADED their own failure, failing to acknowledge the power the retail trading community posseses. 

In fact, the stock has been put in the NYSE restricted list of Short selling. They quite literally can't short this stock anymore. So once this rises again, the MMs have NO REASON to start dropping the price again, as they can't benefit once more from shorting on the way down.

This week we are extremely weak as a community due to the immense number of traders having to transfer to Fidelity/Schwab/other brokers, and the MMs have clearly made great use of this. Hell, Drivewealth, one of the biggest clearing brokers for international traders (such as myself), restricted buying GME, and have said to be able to clear buying GME very soon

But as the fund transfers are complete, and Robinhood acquires more capital to realize their trades, and the other brokers lift restrictions, GME will MOST DEFINITIVELY skyrocket. Once the rocket starts going off again, ALL THE FOMO FROM PEOPLE WHO MISSED 300+ WILL SHOW!

**So the SHORT SQUEEZE STILL CAN HAPPEN.** 

# The long term plan (RYAN COHEN IS GOD, Q4 is still coming)

Don't forget that we still have Ryan Cohen on board, and with expected record sales from this console cycle, Gamestop is very far away from going bankrupt. 

Remember: The ideal situation for shorts is a bankruptcy/delisting.

Ryan Cohen is still in, the Quarterly report for GME is still coming, and the long term prospects of the company are still FUCKING BULLISH.  Even if we can't force a squeeze in february, long term changes done to the company can still trigger a short squeeze. In fact, most of the rise of GME so far has been done through investors buying in, not through short squeezes. 

Yes, it is fact that many shorts have covered (At BILLIONS of losses), but this doesn't change our fundamental thesis: *Gamestop + Ryan Cohen = Rokit mun*. The VW squeeze happened after DAYS of red, you better believe we can end up waiting for a month for the squoze.

# TLDR: HOLD OR BUY MORE, YOU FUCKING APES. IT'S NOT OVER. You know why? BECAUSE

# WE. LIKE. THE. STOCK.

This is market manipulation. Using user data to manipulate the price of a stock without the fUnDaMeNTaLS. CNBC is mad at us for manipulation when for months citadel shorted stocks that WSB heavily did research on. Fuck them. 

shorts will now be scared of WSB and stocks with good fundamentals are back on the fucking table.

GME Rollercoaster,1323,lbv6iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbv6iy/gme_rollercoaster/,120,1612407611.0,"Listen up bag holders, 💎🖐, short bus riders.  

The euphoric feeling you had when you saw GME hit $500 intraday, with dreams of it hitting  $1,000 while yelling,”I’m gonna cooom!!” and the depression accompanying it when it hit $80 yesterday, while you glance at those big, heavy fucking bags in your diamond hands, are nothing new for GME gang. 

It happened in October when it was halted based on MSFT news and then promptly fell back down to earth.  It happened in November/December RC penned the letter to the BoD, run up to earnings where it dropped so hard after omnichannel.  Then RC made a filing to up his stake mid December.  We all know when he tweeted 🥜 around 1/15 opex week.   

After every major drop, GME or RC drops something to quell those doubts. Case in point, they announced 3 new hires today. 

Most of the GME DD prior to the squeeze was that the catalyst for the squeeze would most likely occur in late March/April.  I still stand by that.  

The run up to 1/15 and the subsequent para move was mainly driven by the incredible amount of GME options exp then and the gamma squeeze initiated by retail subsequently sustained by the larger hedge funds.  It always felt inorganic, which was why most current bag holders expected more.  Yes it could’ve reached $1000, 2000, 5000 even - had RH and other brokerages not royally fucked up and fucked every retail trader. Shorts may have covered through redemptions from ETFs with high concentrations of GME shares, they might have covered in other ways.  Who gives a shit.  The fact exists that there are still shorts.  We’ve learned and seen all the dirty tricks in the book thrown our way.  We now know what to be wary about.  We’re not missing our second shot.  
 
Short Squeeze has always been the cherry on top of the GME DD.   The DD was always that it was an undervalued company.  How undervalued is anyone’s guess.  

If restrictions get lifted, and volatility drops a bit, who’s to say gamma squeezes can’t happen again and ride the tendie train every Friday? We seen how TSLA went.  I understand two different industries, valuations, etc.? But gamma squeezes are real and both have asymmetric forward return profile. TSLA rode our FDs like a motherfucker to the moon all last yr. 

If you’ve lost money, you can cut your losses and do what is best for you and your family.  I’m not here to tell you to hold or sell or whatever you want to do with your money/financial decisions.  You can also hold to see how it will play out - you don’t lose if you don’t sell, because there are more catalysts to come (March earnings, 100M shelf offering, share buyback, expansion, LT roadmap).  Again, you do you. 

Just remember, for every high that GME has hit, it’s gone even higher than that in subsequent peaks.  I do think it will go higher than $500 at some point in the near future.  Gut feeling. Call me retarded. Call me crazy.  But that’s what everyone told me when I went in on GME in October.",2021-02-03 20:00:11
An Idiot Proof Step by Step Guide for Transferring Funds from RH,1288,l6x1i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6x1i9/an_idiot_proof_step_by_step_guide_for/,101,1611870579.0,"I have no real vested interest in Fidelity, but removing GME from trading makes me want to spite Robinhood. I don't care what broker you want to transfer to, but Fidelity is one I have used for penny stocks so that's why I'm transferring to there.

I'm going to include a step by step here and include pictures below for the 90% of you who can't read.

**Text Only**

Open Robinhood and click on the icon in the bottom right. Go to settings -> Account information and write down your account number for later. Make sure that the piece of paper you've written on is edible so you can destroy the evidence later.

You'll have to open a Fidelity account which will take about 15 minutes and require some of your basic information. Once you're in Fidelity go the ""Transact"" tab on the bottom right and choose ""Transfer"". Then select ""Transfer assets from another financial institution"" and click ""continue"" on the pop-up. Click ""Start a transfer"" and log in with the log in you created when you created your account. Enter ""Robinhood securities llc"" into the search bar. Enter in the account number you wrote down earlier and choose ""Individual"" for the account type assuming you're an individual investor. Or select whatever type applies. Finally click ""Yes"" and ""Next"".

EDIT: To answer a few questions. RH will charge you $75 for the transfer and it'll take about 5 days according to Fidelity. Also, do your own research on if you want to transfer and where you want to transfer and when. This is only a how-to. Make informed decisions - I'm not your mother.

EDIT 2: Another note from u/withstereosound

>\*\*\*JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH FIDELITY  
>  
>YOUR SHARES ARE FROZEN UNTIL THE TRADE IS COMPLETE

>DONT TRANSFER IF YOURE AFRAID YOU'LL MISS THE SQUEEZE IN THE NEXT 3-5 DAYS

>FUCK ROBINHOOD\*\*\*

Edit 3:  From u/Farores_Favored

>DO NOT TRANSFER YOUR ACCOUNT IF MOVING TO A NEW BROKER. **Open a new account on a different broker and fund it.** If you transfer your account, *it could be up to 15 days before you are even able to sell your transferred securities.* **RH will lock your account during the transfer**. I transferred two weeks ago and still don't have access to the cash in my account and can't transfer it out.

**With Pictures**

Open up your RH account and click the icon in the bottom right.

"$NOK is almost certainly a plant. $GME is the most mechanically likely to squeeze, followed by $AMC and $BB",1262,l94t1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l94t1a/nok_is_almost_certainly_a_plant_gme_is_the_most/,483,1612097184.0,"Sup retards, I rejoined to try and warn you all of the market crash last week thursday, and none of my posts and comments got through, not sure if this will either. 

I'll keep it short and sweet. $NOK is almost certainly a fucking plant, meant to bait you all into buying.

- High float, low price, perfect for retail to pile into
- It's not shorted much at all
- People only started mentioning it *very* recently last week. Out of the non-GME recent meme stocks ($AMC, $BB, $NOK), it's the most recent.
- Retail has gotten fucked on $NOK in the past
- The 5G thesis is great, but it's old fucking news

But OK, all the stuff above is more or less conjecture, let's assume I'm 100% wrong as an unreformed 🌈🐻 (still think that market crash is coming BTW), here's some signal [take another look at the stocks that Robinhood has restricted and how severe the restriction is](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) (as of 1/30):

| Symbol | Allowed Share purchases | Allowed Option Purchases |
|---|----|---|
| $GME | 1 | 5 (minimum of any of them) |
| $AMC | 1 | 10 |
| $BB | 1 | 10 | 
| $NOK | 5 | 10 | 

Which one of these is not like the other? $NOK is basically the least restricted (on both dimensions). I'm personally not super convinced on $BB either but meh.

Just like most other posts on WSB, this is not financial advice. Make your own investment decisions and know when to sell, because when the squeeze ends it will end fast -- make sure you and your friends talk about and exit strategy, we want to sell into Melvin, Citadel, and their friends, not each other. Once liquidity hits zero it would be great if someone started a count of how many shares were bought at the elevated prices.

I will echo something I read in another post here -- for all the 4MM new people here, **WSB LOSES MONEY ON AVERAGE**. We post and celebrate loss porn. $GME is the only safe bet right now, it will be green even in a sea of red because what's happening right now is mechanical, assured. The shorts have not completely covered yet, and they will. It's not about fundamentals, it's not about technicals, it is market mechanics.

[EDIT] People in the comments suggesting I haven't been on this sub long enough to understand why each individual stock is squeezing. Let me lay it out (please let me know if I'm wrong) so people stop suggesting that

- $GME rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze
- $AMC rocketed because short squeeze + gamma squeeze + recent 900M cash infusion, Bankruptcy is 100% off the table
- $BB rocketed because of optimism around security, lack of compromise in Solarwinds
- $NOK rocketed because 5G, and some idea of being under valued (this one I admit I don't understand)

Shut the fuck up about it. If you know the above this post isn't for you.

This post exists to *dispel the fiction that half of these are legitimate short and/or gamma squeezes*. If you thought that $BB and $NOK were short squeezes, YOU ARE WRONG. They *MIGHT* gamma squeeze but certainly not with the restrictions on them.

[EDIT 2] It looks like people are still confused about brokers. There are three brokers that I can recommend, if you're trying to express a view on this market:

- Fidelity
- Vanguard
- TD Ameritrade ([see their restrictions](https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page))

If you're thinking ""You're a fucking plant, how could you recommend TD Ameritrade?"", calm your tits. I have been posting since last week about the *actual* restrictions that are in on TD Ameritrade, fucking read them -- **you *CAN* buy $GME and $GME calls on TD**. The media misreported and never actually listed what the restrictions were for TD (they were one of the first to restrict).

NOTE: I DO NOT KNOW IF TD WILL CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, SO THE SAFEST ARE FIDELITY AND VANGUARD.

Also, I will shill for TD a bit -- when I dumped RH last year because they cost me money, I moved to TD and they forced me to do their education stuff on options and shares and futures before being approved for level 2 options (I'm not a fan of lying on my applications to financial institutions). I actually really fucking enjoyed it and learned a lot. I don't know how they're going to change since they merged with Chuck Schwab, and you could say that all their ""education"" schtick is actually just bullshit to convince you that you know what you're doing *before* you give the big boys your money, but I really like TD.

See my previous comments about TD's actual restrictions from when I called them, on the phone, like a boomer:

I’m working on another DD to add to my GME EndGame series ([part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/), [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/)), but I wanted to take an aside to share my speculations on the obscene amount of manipulation happening this week by the shorts, and try to give all of you advice on how you can be more successful on GME.

**TL:DR;** GME has tremendous potential and the only reason it’s not trading at $80+ is because of active shorting. Be aware about how your positions may be helping the shorts without you knowing.

# How shorts manipulated GME this week

I’m going to preface this by saying this is speculation based on events transpired and what I know about short tactics. Consider this a narrative of how a shorter could have orchestrated all of this. I will share data where I have it. For an understanding of some of those tactics, read this [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l11ww7/legacy_of_wsb_jim_cramers_crash_course_in_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/mirkan__2.

Imagine you’re one of the big shorts on GME. You’ve been shorting this thing since 2017, 2018, 2019 and watched its stock price drop from 30 -> 15 -> 4 to a low of $3 in 2020. If you’re Bank of America, your analysts are telling you (and others) this [thing is going to $1](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/04/15848735/gamestops-short-term-sales-boost-to-power-down-soon-analyst-says).

But then things get out of hand, very quickly, with GME climbing from $3 -> $20 in 9 months and then in **ONE WEEK** doubling to $40. You were not prepared for this. It’s a disaster.

What do you do? You leverage every tactic you can to drive the price down.

**1) Attack retail investing capabilities:**

* Bank of America owns Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch has a retail brokerage. Since you’re short GME, you have your risk department over at Merrill Edge **increase the margin requirements on GME** strongly and suddenly on all retail buyers.
* **This causes a chain reaction**. Brokerages generally mimic the margin changes on other brokerages, because they don’t want to be the ones where all the “risky” traders go to. So other brokerages start increasing their requirements. Pretty soon, Schwab, Fidelity, Ameritrade, IBKR have all increased their margin requirements to the point that many buyers cannot buy more shares, or if they had bought on margin, need to liquidate or provide more capital.
* Meanwhile, the big guys - banks and hedge funds that are short - use [prime brokerages](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-prime-brokerage-4165497), and since I don’t have access to one I can’t confirm, but *very much doubt had any margin changes to GME.*

**2) Manipulative shorting:**

* On **Friday (1/15)** you take advantage of the fact that most call buyers on GME are not going to take assignment, so as they sell their calls which are now worth huge sums of money, Market-makers (MMs) are going to sell the shares they’re using to hedge the calls. So you short the stock as hard as you can, driving it down as low as 14% at one point, but it creates too strong of a sell-off triggering a short-sale restriction.

Great, at this point, you think you’ve killed some of the momentum going into the 3-day weekend. Hopefully investors will realize more of their mistake and sell off their foolish investment in the next Blockbuster. But then things go awry. Retail buyers are not shaken. In fact they’re enraged, and the GME movement grows more popular than ever, becoming the [most mentioned ticker](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1ey7e/heres_a_visualization_of_the_tomorrows_moves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and even getting a stickied thread each day.

The US markets are closed on Monday. Doesn’t matter. Europe takes the mantle, driving the price up from 35 at close on Friday in the US to 40, then 44. **Mexico** picks up the baton, where it hits 1000 pesos, or **$50/share on Monday at 11:30 a.m.** before coming back down a bit.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3y8c8fhixmc61.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e07fbb6fbd0fb39a15a0429d3096760ccf0556a

You’re about to get squeezed and you need to do something fast. You can’t short the price down Tuesday in US trading because of the short sale restriction, and the momentum behind GME is palpable.

So now you get more aggressive.

**3) Orchestrated media attack & shorting:**

* Here’s what you have to work with. There are **at least** **1.2 million** shares available to short in just IBKR, and more in prime brokerages thanks to all the retail buyers buying shares in Robinhood. [“Robinhood Securities earns income from lending margin securities to counterparties.”](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/how-robinhood-makes-money/#:~:text=Robinhood%20Securities%20earns%20income%20from%20lending%20margin%20securities%20to%20counterparties.) At a **54% borrow rate,** that’s quite a nice return for RH for holding your shares.
* You call up a famous shorter known for impacting equity prices - Andrew Left of Citron. Offer him tons of money to put out a hit piece on Tuesday after markets open. It doesn’t matter that he doesn’t have shit prepared and you need him to do this tomorrow. He’s just going to threaten an attack to kill the momentum.
* Tuesday market opens. GME **rockets up 25% to $45/share** within the first few minutes. Then comes the orchestrated attack.
   * Minutes before Citron’s tweet, you buy thousands of OTM puts.
      * **1000** 1/22 40p - **26 minutes before the tweet**
      * **472** 2/29 20p - **24 minutes before the tweet**
      * **2200** 1/29 30p - **11 minutes before the tweet**
      * **424** 1/22 40p - **10 minutes before the tweet**
      * **449** 1/22 40p - **5 minutes before the tweet**

[Biggest option trades on the day of Citron’s tweet. Note that almost all of the large, long option orders are longer term, but the puts are all short term, with many coming minutes before the tweet. Keep in mind, while all this aggressive, OTM, short-term expiry put buying was happening, GME was rocketing upwards. It’s pretty obvious this was planned and not a response to price action. ](https://preview.redd.it/a9naysrkxmc61.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac257a1212129b1aa7d234a77cb563498a4d4fd8)

* At 9:58 a.m. eastern (I’m on the west coast so timestamp is different), comes the tweet

* Note the language here:
   * Citron’s not revealing anything until tomorrow, when short sale restrictions are done. *I.e. you better not buy today!*
   * Price target of $20 **matching exactly the lowest strike price of the puts purchased just minutes prior**.
   * “I understand short interest better than you” - i.e. “the shorts are paying me and I know who they are, and why they’re shorting”
   * “Poker game” - ***he’s calling you a sucker, while at the same time tweeting a poker bluff***\*\*.\*\* He doesn’t actually have anything ready or substantial, but the shorts paid him off to threaten the market.
* Andrew Left fired his shot. Now comes the coordinated shorting.
* In about an hour, **all 1.2 million shares** in Interactive Brokers are used up.

* Probably, prior to this, shorts used the invisible shares available from brokerages like Robinhood.
* Wait, shorts can’t short on restricted days, right? **Wrong.**
   * **They can short on the ask.**
   * When there’s fear in the market, organic sellers lower their ask to exit their positions.
   * Shorts high-frequency algos move their ask to match the lowest organic ask.
   * Organic seller really needs to get rid of these shares! Citron is coming! Sees he’s now not the lowest ask, so he moves it down.
   * Guess what? The algos match his ask and short at the lower price now.
   * **This cycle repeats as long as organic sellers reduce their asks to sell.**
* While all this is happening, **market makers are shorting/selling shares in response to the puts placed prior to the tweet,** helping push down the price.

Congratulations. **In a matter of less than an hour, GME has now dropped from $45 to $37/share - an 18% drop and an** ***absolutely incredible reversal of momentum.***

Citron didn’t even have to do shit. The next day they canceled their livestream claiming they *forgot about the fucking inauguration.*

# How to be smart

As you can see, there are a number of dirty tricks here. It’s sophisticated, coordinated, and the odds are stacked against the retail investor.

There are some things you can do to trade smarter.

* **OPEX.** Imagine if every trader out there took profits of their calls at expiration. In that scenario, MMs sell the shares they used the hedge the calls, leading to a downward drift in price. If instead people rolled forward winning calls, for example, MMs would not necessarily sell the hedge (depends on delta). Selling calls before expiry if you just want to take profits sometimes means you can avoid a drop on OPEX.
* **Robinhood lends your shares and doesn't pay you for it.** Some other brokers let you choose to lend your shares. I know I can choose to lend shares or not in IBKR. It’s up to you to lend or not, but don’t let your broker lend for you and earn all that free lending money.
* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. *Sell high, not low retards.*
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. **Have patience when buying.**
* **Don’t buy calls on rips.** With everyone expecting a squeeze *at any moment* option premiums that are already high rocket to insane levels in minutes. When Citron canceled their livestream GME started to recover, call premiums skyrocketed. You’re absolutely fucked if you buy calls on rips, even if you’re right. Look at this call premium price history for today and *imagine just how fucked you are if you buy calls on rips*:

[Good luck profiting on calls if you buy on rips. ](https://preview.redd.it/hsofwiv5ymc61.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b7ee04c148c095e1f47613ded22844460fe768c)

* **Don’t advertise when you’re going to buy. Just buy dips.** There were so many folks saying “wait for 11:30 to buy!”. Well, look what happened! Just when you thought there’d be a dip, and you were all ready to buy, there was this magical, temporary rapid price spike. Congratulations, advertised to every predatory trader out there when you all were going to buy. Double-win for them: If you fomo’d in at 41 you’re probably gonna paper hands your way out when the shorts push it back down.
* **Don’t buy more than you’re willing to lose.** You need to hold through the dips, and be ok with the extreme volatility. IF you put too much into this all at once, you’re going to get scared when the price goes against you.
* **Consider exercising DEEP ITM calls.** I love u/DeepFuckingValue but he could be making more from his portfolio. He has $2.6M in cash from prior GME winnings but also 1000 April 12 calls. The april 12 calls **are trading at intrinsic value.** Exercising those calls right now would use up $1.2M of capital and add 100K shares to his account, but 1) it would not change the PnL of the portfolio, 2) would increase the liquidity (you lose on spreads when you try to sell deep itm calls), and 3) **would allow him to choose whether or not to lend the shares.** Right now, MMs have hedged his calls with 100K shares, **but they're lending them to shorts and making free money.** In the case of DFV, that's about **$6000 per day** in free money given to market makers for the privilege of lending his shares to shorts. **If you have the cash, and the options trading at intrinsic, consider exercising.** Whether you lend is up to you, but **don't give MMs free money.**

[u\/DeepFuckingValue's Portfolio. Exercising the April 12 calls would not impact his PnL, would increase liquidity, and would give him the option of lending shares \(and earning money\) or not. ](https://preview.redd.it/37hwj00gymc61.png?width=2804&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf3bb9864aee06d5d8c379b3413da2d6a7c7071a)

* **HOLD.** There is so much upside in GME, *that it doesn’t matter what price you buy now if you have patience.* There are so many potential catalysts coming and if all of this dirty behavior is any evidence shorts are scared and looking for cheap buys to get out. **Don’t give up your shares for cheap.** Here’s a quick list of potential catalysts that could happen at any time and any of which would spell more pain for shorts:
   * Share recall for a vote on major issue
   * Cohen becomes CEO

   * Cohen could buy his remaining 7%

The process involves your new broker sending a request to RH requesting to move your portfolio over. When RH gets that request they will IMMEDIATELY freeze your account entirely.  You won’t be able to do anything through RH anymore.  


The process will normally take 3-5 business days but I’m sure with all the insanity going on it’s likely to take considerably longer.

GME - Shkreli Thoughts 1/29,1020,l80sl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l80sl1/gme_shkreli_thoughts_129/,296,1611975390.0,"I was away the last few days giving depositions to a different three-letter government agency--sorry about that. GME continues to be a Carollian experience. Through this looking-glass, there is a world where stock prices do not reflect the value of the underlying companies whose partial ownership is traded through common stock. To some, the market is, more or less, broken, for now. That's not a good or a bad thing. The market mechanism is not supposed to make an implicit judgment. There is information in price, but that information is difficult to divine and interpret. Markets aren't good, bad, rational or irrational: they just are.

  When one group takes action in a market to alter the playing field, the market is not a pure market anymore. It's lost 'integrity' and loses more with every modification. This typically only happens in moments of crisis or technological change: countries ban short-selling, for instance; exchanges will unwind clear 'fat-finger' trades, etc; speed bumps may make the market more 'fair' for the technologically behind. We're learning more about how markets can have what appear to be 'unintended' consequences (flash crashes, GME-style reverse crashes), or can be 'gamed' (spoofing, quant as a whole), but we're back to square one: markets don't have feelings. The rules are simple: post your price, the amount, and the rest is order-matching. All of the rest are modifications against the spirit of the laws of the jungle.
  
So, like you, I'm disgusted by what happened the other day. My guess is the DTC and others required incremental collateral for clearing any GME trades--this required RH to raise capital. I actually don't think RH is to blame here! Every broker did the same thing, so there must be a root cause. I mentioned something like this may happen the other day, and I repeat my admonition to not trade on margin. I suspect GME long buying will require 100% margin at virtually any broker. Brokers have to protect themselves, but they can be influenced by the rest of the parties in their food chain, as we saw.

  GME is still worthless compared to its current price. Keep that in mind. You're buying a flower, a baseball card, a beanie baby, a photocopy of a Picasso, all for prices that you know are a lot more--not just a lot more, but insanely more--than anything close to what it could be worth. Those are the facts: GME is just a shitty retailer that will struggle to survive, let alone become a business worth 20 or 30 billion dollars. All of the Ryan Cohen transformation stuff is BS relative to the price change. A good team may be able to turn around GME to the point where it is worth $40, MAYBE. It'll never be worth $300, or at least, the probability that GME operations could support a reasonable price like that is about as small as my odds of becoming a MLB starting pitcher.
 
 That doesn't mean the stock can't go up. The world is conflating what a market is by trying to assign it implicit judgment. Traders have the right to buy and sell anything they'd like for any price that they'd like. One man's ""bubble"" is another man's ""deep value."" I bought a rap CD for millions of dollars. That's my right. Did I overpay? Well, that's really not a judgment anyone can make, is it? If I paid $10,000,000 for a baseball card which is well-known to trade for $5, then it seems clear I've overpaid, right?
  
No. Speculators buy assets for many reasons. Sometimes its because they're making a value judgment: this is WORTH more than my purchase price. But what does that imply? What is worth or value? Most speculators (I suppose you can define that as a buyer who has an explicit intention to sell at a later date, probably soon) buy things because they are confident they can sell at a higher price soon. The value judgment is secondary, and sometimes not relevant at all. Speculators are the animating spirit of the market. If you curb the ability for speculators to act, you have a farcical excuse of a market. But, you can't blame a clearing broker for saying, ""what happens if your client can't clear this trade?"". The stock just went from 300 to 150--what if your client is broke? To me, the simple answer there is to require 100% margin. Limiting the ability for someone to buy a stock for 100% margin (literally the cash to cover the trade is set aside) smells awful. I wouldn't bother with conspiracies--they won't help you trade well.
  
Many of you are brand new to the world of trading. I've traded my whole life--it is very, very hard. I am not very good at it, to be frank. I do think I'm a very good value investor, and in biotech, an extremely good binary-event trader. 99% of people, including in finance, are not good traders. 99% of people are not good 'value' investors, either. That doesn't mean you shouldn't want to become one or try. But it is inordinately difficult. There's nothing wrong with hobbies or 'side gigs', but I really think you should think about the market like a professional sport, or fighting/boxing league, where you are permitted to 'play with the pros'. It doesn't make too much sense to 'part time' fight Brock Lesnar or take LeBron 1-on-1. But this is what you're doing when you trade. Be careful.
  
For those newish to trading, here is my advice on some reading materials:

1) Market Wizards series. This is one of the best series on great investors/traders, which takes you into the mind of the successful trader, in their words. It's always by the same author (JS), too, who is very experienced and knowledgable.
    
2) Trading to Win by Ari Kiev. Read it. Probably the best book on the theory of trading ever written.
    
3) AVOID most books on trading. Unless there is a reason to read them that you can really digest, they're probably empty wastes of time at best, or at worse, could mislead you into some terrible strategy. You can't go wrong reading the books by or about people who have made fortunes in the market. But always take everything as a grain of salt. AVOID the opinions of others in general. This sounds self-referential, but will make a little bit more sense after reading 1/2.
  
When you read these books, you'll realize that my life of 'value investing' is basically irrelevant to the near-term of the stock market, especially in situations like GME or TSLA. GME will probably go down over time, as I mentioned, because it is wildly overvalued and, generally, wildly overvalued stocks tend to go down over time. That doesn't have to be true. That's why investors diversify and 'stop-loss' and do other things to protect themselves. You should do all of that, too. My style, and those of others, simply relate the price of something to the amount of cash it can generate. That's value investing in a nutshell, and it is what the entire industry of Private Equity (Blackstone, Apollo, Carlyle, etc.) is all about. Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds do a little of this as well, but to decide whether a stock will go up or down is this dark art called 'trading'. The ""next"" Steve Cohen might be being born right here, right now, in WallStreetBets. Who knows.
  
I still think GME will trade at 1,000. Why? I am guessing, like all of you, and every other trader out there. No one knows anything. As I mentioned, the borrow interest rate is what I think is important to watch. You're at a disadvantage to other traders in that respect: hedge funds can pull up that information through phone calls, contacts, etc. which you are hopeless to compete against. It doesn't mean they're going to make money and you won't. It's just something to think about. I like 1,000: it's a big round number that is meaningful in the psychology of the markets, to a very small extent. It may trade there for 5 seconds, or it may trade there and keep going higher. For some reason, I think the stock has a bit of ""destiny"" to go there. I may be 100% wrong. As I said, to the extent I have any skill at all, it's generally in being able to predict the value of stocks of companies (and other assets) many years from now, and in biopharma, if anywhere. 
  
I hope everyone does well, and even is being entertained, by all of this. Just make sure that if you have a massive gain in GME, that you 'take something off the table'. Don't be greedy. Some of this money is life-changing. Even if it is 10% of your position, book some kind of gain. It will feel good. Be objective. Don't use margin--you may lose more than you can afford. I've been there. It sucks balls worse than you can imagine. Don't do it for GME, even if RH or anyone else lets you. Don't go too crazy with options, even if they let you. I hope you all are able to buy Wu-Tang albums, tendies, autism treatment and whatever else your hearts desire at the 'end' of this, whatever that means. 
  Good luck WSB, I love you!

💎🙌Comprehensive GME Diamond Hand Strategy Guide💎🙌,970,lahcsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahcsd/comprehensive_gme_diamond_hand_strategy_guide/,88,1612250480.0,"“If you **know** the **enemy** and **know** yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you **know** yourself but not the **enemy**, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you **know** neither the **enemy** nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”  - Sun Tzu

We're in a war with the hedge funds and with wallstreet and basically the root of corruption in America with our GME short squeeze proxy war, and if you autists want to win this war, you need to know the enemy, and know yourself.Firstly, education is KEY, so if you're new, you DEFINITELY need to go learn at least what a short squeeze is and a short ladder attack is.

What the enemy is doing:

1. ***Price manipulation:*** With short ladder attacks, they use high frequency trading to make the price artificially lower.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme\_volume\_still\_low\_with\_positive\_cmf\_which/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4pji/gme_volume_still_low_with_positive_cmf_which/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont\_panic\_and\_just\_look\_at\_the\_fucking\_volume/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la5upr/dont_panic_and_just_look_at_the_fucking_volume/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for\_those\_of\_you\_getting\_scared\_look\_at\_that\_tiny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laak53/for_those_of_you_getting_scared_look_at_that_tiny/)This can be seen with sizeable price movements that have tiny amounts of volume. There are several reasons why they are doing this:
   1. Scare off paper hand bitches: They prey on people who jumped on GME without even knowing what a short squeeze is; they see price fall, they paper hands and they get out.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall\_street\_plan\_trying\_to\_psychologically\_scare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/)
   2. Make it cheaper for them to cover their more costly short positions.
   3. Price manipulation will fail ultimately because while they are able to drive prices lower with their short attacks, when they eventually have to cover their short positions and buy, they will again drive prices up due to purchases of almost none existing stock (cuz we be holding), sending prices up as high as before they shorted or even higher. All the while hedge funds will continue to eat fees and interest on their short positions, making this cycle not doable indefinitely.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme\_mms\_have\_until\_tomorrow\_22\_to\_buy\_shares\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7bhj/gme_mms_have_until_tomorrow_22_to_buy_shares_it/)
2. ***Media manipulation***
   1. Most if not all American main stream media is clearly serving corporate and wallstreet interests, simply by the false narratives they are reporting.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1022/hmmm/)They are not to be trusted and if seen, can dishearten and shake the will of those who don't have diamond hands. Best to avoid if you are a paper handed bitch. Some examples of false narratives are:
      1. Reddit is made up of alt-rights, or idiots, or gamblers, etc. -> We're not idiots, because we're the ones who were able to grab wallstreet by the nutsack. We're retards and autists who love the stock and the company. That is all.
      2. Reddit is moving on to silver. -> SILVER CANNOT BE SQUEEZED!!!!! With a market cap of more than $1.5 Trillion, there is NO WAY for retail investors to be able to make a dent in that. The only possible short squeeze play is GME because it's a small cap company with a market cap of only $250 million as of July 2020, so it is definitely doable for a bunch of retards on WSB to affect the price of a small cap company stock. Literally all the posts on reddit promoting SLVR are from bot accounts that have sus creation dates and karma and post counts. Plus, Citadel owns a giant amount of silver so silver prices going up higher is gonna benefit them and give them more fuel to fight this GME war. You're shooting yourself int eh foot if you buy SLVR. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess\_who\_owns\_tonnes\_of\_slv\_options\_fuck\_citadel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/)
      3. ""XXX IS THE NEXT GME"" -> This is also a false narrative. NOTHING can be the next GME, because NOTHING is shorted as much as GME, which is STILL over 100% shorted. GME IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY GAIN FOR US, AND LOSS FOR THEM!
      4. Shorts have covered their position. -> Another false narrative. Short interest is still over at 100%, and there are multiple WSB posts that explain this. Another metric that correlates to short interest is cost of borrowing for opening short positions, which would increase if it is harder to find shares to short.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no\_more\_shares\_to\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no_more_shares_to_short/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme\_short\_interest\_is\_currently\_sitting\_at\_12297/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laaai8/gme_short_interest_is_currently_sitting_at_12297/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme\_short\_interest\_increased\_to\_7141m\_after\_jan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5d6sk/gme_short_interest_increased_to_7141m_after_jan/)
3. ***Breaking the law:*** Some if not all of the things posted above are pretty much border line illegal, but there has been clear signs of breaking the law and market manipulation, IE: freeze buying of select stocks and only allow for selling. They can spin it however they want, but as far as I know, it has been unprecedented for a majority of brokerages to simultaneously alter the way a stock can be traded with cash. And if the situation is desparate enough, they'll break the law again and again if it ends up costing them less than to just let the price get to $69.420. Expect them to fight dirty until the bitter end.
4. ***Social Media Manipulation:*** Hedge Funds now employ bots to spread doubt and misinformation in order to weaken your hands. Some places they target is WSB itself, other stock trading subreddits, facebook, and on sites / apps like Webull and Yahoo Finance. Don't believe in random comments. Always believe in WSB posts with huge amounts of likes (top posts are vetted by the 8 mil users here / by mods too to make sure they're factual)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in\_case\_you\_needed\_proof\_that\_there\_are\_imposters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafh4d/in_case_you_needed_proof_that_there_are_imposters/)
5. ***Their Current Strategy:*** Wallstreet calls us ""dumb money"", because they think we are unsophisticated and just chase after a quick buck, and we have short attention spans. They'll try and continue to manipulate the price so that the stock will trade sideways, or continuous short ladder attacks, trying to scare paper hands into selling, and bore diamond hands into selling as well. They will also try to tempt us with other ""NEXT GME"" type plays and may even artificially raise prices of a stock or two (IE: SILVER) to try and get people to hop off the GME rocket. They'll use media to continue to push narratives that the GME short squeeze is over, short positions are covered, and redditors have moved onto something else. If this fails, then they may simulate a ""SQUEEZE"" by suddenly letting the price go up to $700 or $800, then unleash a short ladder attack unlike which we have ever seen, to simulate the sell off, so idiot retards will be scared into thinking they missed the top, so they will all sell. But if people just look at the volume, they'll know it's all a ruse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What we're doing, our advantage, and why the enemy can't win.

1. ***This is a movement:*** This has become more than a few people of a subreddit trying to make a quickbuck off of a short squeeze. This has become a movement that represents the struggle between the corruption of wallstreet and the 1% vs the 99%, the common people. News agencies from all over the globe are reporting on this and have their eyes on this. We have ape brothers and sisters all over the world buying and holding this stock together. We even have a few outspoken whales on our side as well, as well as politicians from both sides of the spectrum speaking out for our side as well. We have billboards being bought all over the country, airplanes flying banners about GME. A global movement will crush any hedge fund.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme\_short\_squeeze\_the\_whales\_have\_arrived/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5mt6n/gme_short_squeeze_the_whales_have_arrived/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill\_stjerne\_is\_da\_real\_mvp\_he\_his\_friends\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qtey/kjetill_stjerne_is_da_real_mvp_he_his_friends_are/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times\_square\_right\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rf4k/times_square_right_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
2. ***We are holding, and we're continuing to buy:*** We are getting smarter, tougher, and slowly but surely paper hands are turning into diamond hands. We managed to hold during the short attack to \~$110 on Thursday, and that was when they froze our ability to buy across many brokerages. They will never have another chance to do this again now with everyone watching. The volume trading these days is getting smaller and smaller. Any price decrease is strictly from short ladder attacks, and not us selling, due to tiny tiny volumes. Also, we are continuing to buy calls on GME to increase upward pressure. No one here has stopped buying. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labvei/volume\_is\_low\_dont\_believe\_the\_news\_no\_one\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labvei/volume_is_low_dont_believe_the_news_no_one_is/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83ctf/the\_volume\_of\_gme\_has\_plummeted\_the\_past\_few\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83ctf/the_volume_of_gme_has_plummeted_the_past_few_days/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions\_in\_gme\_calls\_bought\_today\_at\_800\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagd2m/millions_in_gme_calls_bought_today_at_800_hold/)
3. ***Nuclear Bomb still undetonated***\*:\* Short Squeeze still coming, it hasn't happened yet. We know this because the volume of shares bought is not nearly enough to show the shorts have bought enough to be covered.[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2\_nyse\_quotes\_for\_gme\_volume\_the\_squeeze\_hasnt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1q9hy/l2_nyse_quotes_for_gme_volume_the_squeeze_hasnt/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme\_volume\_is\_low\_shorts\_arent\_covering\_hold/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l66kcl/gme_volume_is_low_shorts_arent_covering_hold/)
4. ***Enemy loses money everyday, we don't:*** It costs the hedge funds billions to continue to fight this war of attrition becauase they continue to eat insanely high fees and interest on their short positions because the cost of borrowing remains high because the short interest are remaining high. Melvin down over 50% just this month alone. You think they can hold on much longer and keep eating fees?[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this\_is\_so\_satisfying\_to\_look\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/labq1a/this_is_so_satisfying_to_look_at/)Meanwhile we don't have to pay anything for holding our stocks. We can literally just hold and not have a short squeeze and just from the cost of borrowing alone the hedge funds will run out of money, so that's why there will come a time where it's cheaper for them to cover their positions rather than just keep on bleeding until they die out. I don't think they can hold out for another month of trading sideways with no progress. I believe in Feb we will see some major action. It could even start as early as tomorrow, because that's the last day shorts have to cover their 1/29 puts that expired.
5. ***We're not breaking the laws, they are:*** Recent rumor mills are saying that there are a lot of [counterfit stocks](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) circulating and the hedge funds and clearing houses are all in on it, and once they need to start to find shares to buy to cover their short positions, things are going to explode in a way that is unprecedented. Basically by taking advantage of a situation wallstreet has set up (insane short interest set up for short squeeze) we may have uncovered one of the biggest financial crimes in the history of the stock market. You bet that the government and SEC will be involved soon if this is true, and things will explode to the stratosphere. Read the following and ponder yourself, I'm not a financial advisor, just a dumb ape. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)[https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow\_the\_crumbs\_gme\_exposed\_the\_meta/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
6. ***We're getting smarter:*** Everyday we get new DD on WSB and more and more people are reading these DD's and understand how to diamond hands, and can now filter out fake news from mainstream media. We've just hit 8 mil subs; our subs are going exponential. We've recovered from the RH fiasco and we're primed and loaded on other brokerages like Fidelity. We are more ready than EVER to continue this war and this fight.
7. ***An Ape's Move this week:*** Again, not financial advice, but hypothetically if there was an autistic ape, the autistic ape would buy the dips, ESPECIALLY at this insane discount price of around $100. The autistic ape knows that basically it is paying $100 for a ticket to ride the GME train past $1k, easily 10x their bananas. Those apes who bought in at $300 will only get to 3x their bananas at the end of the month. The autistic apes will also understand that this is not a 1 day thing, but the events leading up to the squeeze can take weeks. But the autistic ape will ask itself, is it willing to wait a few weeks to at least 3x their bananas? Most apes will answer yes. But the ape knows if they buy it, they should be prepared to see red in their banana tracker for a month. But those red number are just fake numbers generated by HFT short ladder attacks, and not due to other apes actually selling their bananas, because apes together STRONK.

# Transferring from RH to Fidelity

This process is actually very simple.

1. Log on to your Fidelity trading account on a browser.
2. In a different tab, log on to your RH account. Go to your info, and copy your RHS account number. Focus back on the Fidelity tab after copying this number.
3. In the top right of the Fidelity home page, type ""transfer asset"". Click on the link, and you should be in the Transfer of Assets (TOA) page.
4. Click on ""Start a transfer""
5. In the ""Select your current firm"" field, type ""Robinhood"". It should show up as ""Robinhood Securities Llc."". Select that to go to the next step.
6. In the next screen, paste the previously copied RH account number, and select ""individual"" in the account type.
7. In the next screen, you can select a specific equity or the whole account.
8. Wait 2-3 days for your RH account to show nothing, and a day or two after that for everything to pop up on Fidelity.
9. Now, you may shut down the RH account. Make sure you download ALL transactions before you close out the account. Who knows whether RH will even exist by the time it's the next tax filing season.

PSA FOR ROBINHOOD USERS: Take daily screenshots of account balance and holding for the forseeable future,927,l9jhcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jhcb/psa_for_robinhood_users_take_daily_screenshots_of/,212,1612149203.0,"Robinhood has recently been restricting withdrawals on people's accounts. There have been a number of posts lately regarding this, and on Friday I also fell victim to Robinhood locking up my cash and preventing me withdrawing to my bank.

I highly recommend everyone to take daily screenshots of their account until you have transferred to a different brokerage or closed all positions and cashed out.

I would also highly recommend doing this on a computer if possible, so that you can make sure all relevant information, including the name on the account, every stock/option you are currently holding, the total account value, and the date/time are all visible within a single image.

This may be the only way to protect yourself in the case that RH faces a liquidity crisis and takes all of your hard earned tendies. RH is insured up to $500,000, with up to $250,000 being cash.

Also, $GME to the moon, diamond hands, and all that other jazz

EDIT: Because I just realized this, I also recommending downloading a statement, and overlaying it over the RH portfolio on your browser, so that you can also capture the account number and name. 2-factor authentication will go a long way if you end up filing an insurance claim when RH goes bankrupt.

EDIT 2: Many are suggesting screen recording apps for active trading during market hours. I will 100% be using such software and I stand by these posters and suggest everyone else uses these screen capture applications. I have seen AZ Screen Recorder recommended. If anyone has other suggestions, post a comment and I will add them to the list.

GME Short Squeeze: What Comes Next,922,lapovy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lapovy/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/,126,1612277355.0," 

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.",2021-02-02 07:49:15
An oversimplification of short ladders for anyone who still doesn't understand why today's dip happened,909,l7lqm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7lqm6/an_oversimplification_of_short_ladders_for_anyone/,128,1611931454.0,"**/u/wolfyd33 recorded a baller audiobook version of this.

I've gotten my mom interested enough in this that she's been loosely following it, and she was massively confused today on how I knew not to panic sell (💎👐, obviously, but you can't really verbalize that). This is how I helped her grasp that the dip never really happened at all. It ignores or mis-analogizes certain aspects, like the fact that the shares being traded often don't even exist, but I think I'm correct on the essential mechanics.

I'm Sleazy Joe and I own a buy-here-pay-here car dealership. John Blow walks in with a Cadillac Escalade he wants to sell me. John's Escalade is worth $40,000 or $50,000, but I'm never going to make money if I pay him that, so I need a way to convince him it's worth less.

I have another Escalade already on the lot, and my friend Sleazy Jim owns another dealership across the street. I pick up the phone and ask Jim if he wants to buy a Cadillac Escalade for $38,000. He accepts and I fax him the title. Two minutes later, I get a call from Jim and lo and behold, he has a Cadillac Escalade to sell me for $36,000. I accept and he faxes me the title back. We keep doing this until we get to something pitiful like $8,000, and now I have something I can print off and show John to say ""I'm sorry, but the market value for your vehicle is what it is and I can't justify offering you more than that."" John doesn't have access to the specific people behind the sales he's looking at, and although he *does* have access to the fact that very few Escalades actually changed hands on the way down to $8,000, he probably doesn't know to look at that, let alone what it implies. So he throws his hands up and I get his $40,000 Escalade for $8,000.

This is what happened today with GME. Institutions were doing incredibly volume-thin, rapid sales back & forth between themselves, at precipitously decreasing prices, because they wanted $500 (or $10,000+, depending upon how you look at it) GME for $125. What's more, they managed to get brokers to almost completely lock retail out so it couldn't correct by buying the ""dip,"" greatly increasing the amount of downward movement they were able to simulate. Importantly, it looks like they largely failed, but worse such attacks will happen as they get more desperate and longs seeing through them is the only thing that can make them continue to fail. 

TL;DR: Read the post, but almost none of the ""sales"" that created the GME ""dip"" today were people actually exiting their positions or day-trading. Institutions sold the stock back & forth to one another rapidly enough to create the impression of a mass sell-off, and faced almost no resistance doing so because of RH et al.'s lockout.",2021-01-29 07:44:14

BEWARE WEEKEND SCARE TACTICS

We made it through the battle today and are UP 69% (nice). The hedges are only getting more desperate after the put options that expired today but REMEMBER: they have at LEAST 2-6 days in the market to pay these off, and likely have MANY MORE options expiring in coming weeks. With the lack of shenanigans today I predict an extended-hours ladder attack is incoming when many retail traders are sidelined from the action, combined with another media push of scare tactics incoming this weekend. We were caught off guard with the RH bullshit but hopefully enough people can get set up with Fidelity next week to even the playing field. But above all else: fuckin hold and we're golden

DON'T TRUST EXTENDED HOURS PRICES TODAY OR MONDAY MORNING.

 DON'T TRUST ANY MEDIA HITPIECES CLAIMING THE SQUEEZE IS OVER THIS WEEKEND. 

THEY WILL TRY TO KILL THE HYPE WHEN TRADING IS DOWN AND CAUSE A MONDAY SELL-OFF.

With inexperience come a lot of psychological phallacies that Funds are exploiting:

# BUY LOW SELL HIGH.

*The. Core. Principal. Of. Trading.*

You never, ever sell when down. You don't. If you sell at loss you're literally **BUYING HIGH AND SELLING LOW!!!** If you don't 100% NEED this money RIGHT FUCKING NOW. Do. Not. Sell. It would be more entertaining literally burning money then selling at artificially low prices. NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO SELL. If you're getting nervous about LOSSES ----> DONT LOOK AT THE STOCK. DELETE YOUR APP. DO NOT GET STRESSED AND EMOTIONAL. You are not acting rationally when emotions get involved in trading. NEVER SELL EMOTIONALLY. Emotions are your enemy in trading and you WILL LOSE MONEY. If you're emotionally attached to your invested money, try avoiding any further trades until you're set up where you can (emergency fund, tax advantaged accounts etc. can help you feeling more secure).

It's negative today, it may be negative tomorrow. The DD still stands. GME as a company is in the spotlight of the world. It has a future.

Even if there will be no short squeeze. DO NOT SELL AT LOSS. WAIT. 1 year, 3 years, 10 years. WHATEVER. It can get green again. IT CAN AND IT MAY. If you sell at loss, it wont.

I KNOW THIS IS NO TYPICAL WSB (NON) ADVICE, BUT WITH SO MANY FUCKING RETARDS JUMPING IN WITH NO FUCKING CLUE WHAT THEIR DOING IT NEEDS TO BE SAID.

Some more autistic shit

# Percieved Value:

Remember when you bought your shares. Let's say you bought at $300. You made the decision that this stock, its potential and emotional value, is worth $300 to you and you bought.

Now the Price is artificially driven down. The beginning value hasn't changed. No one says that stock is worth less, unless you do. Unless you yourself decide that you're willing to sell at a lower price.

When selling at $100 -> YOU ARE SAYING IT'S WORTH THIS LITTLE. YOU DECIDE AT WHAT PRICE YOU'RE WILLING TO SELL. If you don't WANT to sell at $100 WAIT TILL YOU CAN SELL IT TO FUCKING MELVIN AT $6000.

Plus: Loss Aversion

A loss of 10% is emotionally more powerfull than a gain of 10%. They are preying on this effect to bring you to make an emotional decision to PANIC and sell at loss. WHICH ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LOSE MONEY.

&#x200B;

HOLD TODAY

HOLD TOMORROW

HOLD FOREVER

IF YOU NEED THE MONEY, WAIT FOR IT TO FUCKING TURN GREEN YOU IMBECILE.

THIS IS JUST A DELUSIONAL AUTISTIC FUCK SPEAKING AND NO FINANCIAL ADVICE.

EDIT:

Since WSB became a fucked up game of finding an imposter -> I was active on WSB a while ago on a different account (MICRON, early AMD) and since moved to subs like /r/financialindependence /r/FIRE etc. and switched to low-cost index funds and mainly stick to this kind of investments and kept an eye on WSB for enterntainment. This account has since been deleted by me because friends of mine (and coworkers) got ahold of that accounts username. I had some history that was too personal for them to know about.

I only moved onto the GME bandwagon out of spite, the moment BUY's got blocked on RH. This is the only and last ""WSB"" move I'm gonna do. 

It doesn't have any meaning as I could write whatever, but my username is my job in the banking sector. I know people that work in HF's, used to work decades in HF's. I didn't quite believe what they told me about the possibilities they have. But now I do.

Buy low, sell high is the foundation of any trade you do. Even GME. 

If you thought this move would be a quick buck over a few days, no. If you bought after the surge, it just doesn't make ANY sense selling. NONE. You cut your potential of any breakeven, ever.

Even if the short squeeze wouldn't happen due to highly illegal tactics by HF, GameStop has way more potential now than before. The company is in international spotlight, has an easy way to raise capital after the trade still, has global logistics... It still has potential as a company, if you sell now, you lose out on any chance of ever covering that loss.",2021-02-03 01:47:12
My DD on Palantir.,789,kyzeuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyzeuv/my_dd_on_palantir/,289,1610886725.0,"Normally I don’t do this kind of thing, but I’ve had far too much wine, just enough weed, and I’m feeling kinda jolly this evening, so let me spit some knowledge for my fellow Retards about everyone’s favorite eye in the sky these days: Palantir. Demo Day is coming on Jan 26th, and leading up to that will be a buying opportunity, because Palantir’s is 🚀going 🚀to 🚀the 🍆fuckin’ 🌖moon, boys. Get your helmets on, and strap in. This 🚀rocket’s about to blast off.

Palantir’s pretty well-established in the Data Analytics community with Big Government contracts pouring money into it's R&D projects. You don’t need to turn a profit when the Government uses you for their skunkworks dept. Especially this early on the explosion of industry that is Surveillance.

Speaking of surveillance... let’s take a little walk down memory lane, shall we. Y’all remember Barack Obama, right? Tan suit? Dijon mustard? The guy who [wrote annual Presidential Executive Orders declaring a continued State of National Emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_the_United_States) that brought us the NSA cell phone bullshit, along with all the other erosions of our privacy we are now totally accustomed to, and largely gave us the rise of Mass Surveillance? Turns out, ol' Barry had some pretty colorful characters working for him. One of those characters was this total badass named [Avril Haines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Haines)

If you don’t know about her, [you should.](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/30/939722113/the-winding-journey-of-avril-haines-bidens-pick-to-lead-u-s-intelligence) Again, because she’s a badass. Studied Judo in Japan, apparently became bored with that at some point and casually studied theoretical physics at University of Chicago. Somehow that wasn’t exciting enough for her, so in her down time, she ended up buying a used-up, junk-ass Cessna airplane, and rebuilt the avionics herself. Once that little weekend project was completed, she tried to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and crash-landed near the Newfoundland coast. No shit. I mean, who does that?! A badass judo hobbyist who dabbles in theoretical physics, that’s who. Now, she did crash, yes, but: her co-pilot ended up falling in love and wife’in the shit out of her. I mean, can you blame the guy? They cuddled for awhile and opened up a little bookstore in the ghetto of Baltimore, hoping the danger of a drug riddled city could hold her lust for excitement and adventure. Shocker: it couldn’t.

By the early 2000’s, she was bouncing around government jobs doing lawyer stuff, and that’s when she met Joe Biden. Several high-profile positions followed, but the one I want to focus on happens in 2010, when she gets a seat at the table to be Deputy National Security advisor. Three years later? [She replaced Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy and former acting director.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cias-deputy-director-to-be-replaced-with-white-house-lawyer/2013/06/12/8fc2118e-d383-11e2-8cbe-1bcbee06f8f8_story.html)

That’s right, you heard me. The CIA.

Speaking of Joe Biden... guess who he just nominated to be the Director of National Security?. If you said Avril Haines, you get a good star.
“Daegoba; what the fuuuuck does this have to do with Palantir?” Well... do any of you degenerates know who was the first investor in Palantir? [A little company called In-Q-Tel; the venture capital firm of the CIA.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel) They kicked Thiel [a cool $2 million waaaaaay back in 2003, just as he got the company off the ground.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies)

Now, wouldn’t it stand to reason that maybe, just maybe, it would be a safe bet to assume that the company who helped kill Osama bin Laden, with all these old friends getting together to run the US Government over the next few years, will see a little bit of success? You think!?

If this isn’t your next big play over the long term, I don’t know; you should full send your window licking hobby and surrender your RH account to your wife's boyfriend. Palantir will be a giant in the next two years at the very least, and a Juggernaut in Data Analytics long into the foreseeable future.

Now, go. Invest in Palantir, and retire early. You’re welcome.

Aphria/Tilray Merger,765,lg5lq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5lq3/aphriatilray_merger/,282,1612913032.0,"Second time posting this. Made it last night but other than a collab between CGC and APHA, news about the merger seems to be the same this morning.

This is my first DD so please bare with me in case I set something up wrong; I'm happy to edit if so but this took me a while to gather.

I just joined this sub about two weeks ago amidst the GME hype. I've been investing for a few years now ever since the Tilray IPO at $17. Bought, sold, and reinvested consistently (pulling out my principal each time) right up through the almost $300 peak and backed out. I left Tilray alone for a while until recently when the news regarding the merger with Aphria started popping up because I actually love Aphria and I've owned it for a while now, so I wanted to post some DD regarding the merger. Hope this helps some of you.

**For the business:** Reverse merger is taking place where Aphria is absorbing Tilray and will own 63% of the company, continuing to use the name Tilray due to better brand recognition and its nearly eponymous representation of the cannabis market. Aphria has a strong presence in Germany which is the only European country with medical marijuana, so Aphria has an advantage in that sector for if/when other European nations start following suit. With both Aphria's and Tilray's international relations along with slowly migrating into the US they may grow into the largest cannabis company worldwide just in terms of revenue.

Over the previous 12 months, Aphria put up $443 million USD in revenue compared to Canopy Growth's $377m USD. Tilray has put up $201m USD in the last 12 months, and which combined with Aphria is $644m USD, or markedly higher than the $377m USD posted by the ""industry standard,"" Canopy Growth. (I don't hate on Canopy as a company whatsoever I just think they're overvalued and their stock should not be in the $40s).

Stats from the merger indicated a $685 million annual revenue, adjusted for combined sales, and the company itself, named Tilray, will have a roughly $3.5 billion valuation.

Also, many forget that Tilray has a business partnership with Anheuser-Busch and Aphria owns the craft beer company SweetWater. (Which, personally, is fucking delicious.)

**For the shareholder:** Each Aphria share will convert to 0.8381 shares of Tilray. As of today (Monday, 02/08/21) the closing price of Tilray was $30.09 and the price of Aphria was $18.98. In accordance to the **1 : .8381** conversion rate, the implied price of Aphria is $25.22, which has a 33% upside compared to the current share price.

I don't know the current borrowing rates (if anyone does please feel free to comment), but in January of 2019 the shorting cost for Tilray was above 900% and has been known to remain very high on this stock, as after it's $300 rally a couple years ago it became a favorite among the shorts. There is a way in which to capitalize on the merger by being long on Aphria and short Tilray, but the 30% profit may be outweighed by the crazy high costs of borrowing.

The two biggest risks appear to be the possibility that Aphria shares will crash days before the merger, or that that Tilray has simply been overvalued this entire time and its share price will fall. (*The strategy is listed in the sources here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play) *& here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses) *but you can only open the articles once without a subscription*

**For everyone:** The general consensus on both stocks is bullish, however, more focus is placed on buying into Tilray than Aphria, seemingly just due to the belief that people may jump ship days before Aphria shares are converted into Tilray (even though Aphria still owns the operation). The company will also have easy access into the United States as our president restructures drug scheduling, so moving forward, I feel that Tilray is going to be a strong global competitor in the cannabis industry for some time

I try not to go balls deep on anything that has a lot of hype on it, but Tilray made me BANK right when I first started investing a few months before Canada legalized so I may be biased. However, as objectively as I can be, I do think this merger is both a very strong short and long option.

I don't really know if it's a necessary disclaimer or a joke but I'm gonna go ahead and say no, none of this is financial advice.

**My positions:** 100 APHA @ $11.13,  2 TSLA @ $408.66,  3 GME @ $165,  10 AMC @ $17.04,  100 SNDL @ $1.13,  100 22 RIGL @ $4.40

Calls: APHA $20 2/19,  TLRY $37 2/19,  SENS $4 2/19,  CRBP $3 2/19,  RIGL $5 2/19

I'm transferring both my RH and TDA accounts over to Fidelity so all my stocks are in different places atm, otherwise I'd post a picture.

Edit 2:  Added the following list below of supporting info for legalizing marijuana nationwide.

A trio of U.S. senators has given investors the green light to invest in  marijuana stocks, an endorsement that suggests the volatile sector might finally  blossom into something as acceptable and regulated as alcohol.

More details will emerge when Sens. Cory Booker (D., N.J.),  Ron Wyden, (D., Ore.), and Chuck Schumer (D.,  N.Y.) introduce legislation to legalize and tax marijuana.

""In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft  on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and  implement responsible taxes and regulations,"" they announced Feb.  1 in a joint statement.

The marijuana sector has, naturally, advanced higher. The sector proxy, the  ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange- traded fund , has seemingly entered a new,  higher trading range. The ETF holds 35 stocks, including Aphria(APHA) , Canopy Growth(CGC) , and GW Pharmaceuticals(GWPH) . The fund has about  $1.4 billion under management, which makes it the largest ETF  that targets the global cannabis industry.

In anticipation of the pending legislation, and in an attempt to harness the  momentum of other investors, aggressive investors can consider buying ETFMG  Alternative Harvest. The ETF is trading near a record high, but an options  strategy can potentially reshape the price.

With the ETF at $27.82, investors can sell the March  $25 put option for $1.90 and buy the March  $29 call option for about $2.80. The ""risk  reversal"" -- selling a put and buying a call with a higher strike price but  similar expiration -- positions investors for agreeing to buy the ETF at  $25 and for participating in gains above $29.

If the ETF is at $35 at March expiration, the call is worth $6.

The trade's risk is predicated on the pending legislation. The trade obligates investors to buy the stock at $23, or to cover the put  or roll the position, if the stock price is below the strike price at  expiration. For that reason, only do this trade if you have the resources and  willingness to buy the ETF at a lower price and a belief in marijuana's pending  legalization. If something happens in Washington that derails marijuana legalization  efforts, the trade falls apart.

Still, the trade is a good way for investors to gain exposure to the  legalization of marijuana, which seems like a good bet as federal government  contends with massive deficits caused by the 2007-09 financial crisis and the  Covid-19 pandemic.

The ETF was chosen over component stocks to potentially reduce the investment  risk that is inherent in picking stocks in an unusual sector with companies that  have a history of extraordinary price volatility.

During the past 52 weeks, the ETF has ranged from $8.81 to  $27.90. The fund gained about 45% over the past year and is up  some 67% this year. The percentage returns seem stellar, but it is important to  remember that the fund has advanced off a low price, and that many of the  components weren't much better situated. The sector could be facing a critical  moment, and this trade puts investors into the center of the industry with a  strategy that can be reset as each month passes.

GME Simplified: Supply vs. Demand,749,lb88l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb88l8/gme_simplified_supply_vs_demand/,145,1612333058.0,"I love how Cuban put it- the reason GME is down is because there is not enough demand (mostly due to RH restricting). In the past week, the enemy has done a mighty good job of making this stock look less appealing. We need to counter it by making people want this stock. We can't just like it. We must LOVE it and make OTHERS LOVE it. We need to remind everyone of the mission and what's at stake. Even if it doesn't squeeze, if we just keep buying the stock, it will go up. And nothing will bring on the squeeze more than the price going up.

Robinhood is A Crucial Element In This Battle. Don’t Let Them Off The Hook.,729,l82xwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82xwk/robinhood_is_a_crucial_element_in_this_battle/,77,1611980225.0,"Why? Because it’s the platform that the majority of people use to trade GME. In my earlier post I explained the psychology of why the additional steps needed to find a new broker is unattractive to most new investors. By making it harder to buy shares, less people will go out of their way to buy them. 

Retail investing is strong because of Robinhood, it’s the ease and simplicity that attracts people. The familiarity and social proof from seeing screenshot after screen shot helps too. Names like Fidelity and Vanguard are slightly more intimidating and perceivably more “complex” when in actuality, they are not (although the UI less beginner friendly imo).

Just moments ago I noticed Robinhood switched the 5 shares limit down to 1. Meaning if you own more than 1 share of GME you cannot buy anymore thus continuing to remove buying pressure. 

If Robinhood were to remove all buying restrictions it would enable millions of potential pent up buyers who are simply too, for lack of a better word, lazy to switch brokers. The volume has been much lower since RH’s buying restrictions, 170m+ every day from 1/22-1/26, while today less than 40m so far.

We seemed to have let RH off the hook after their announcement stating that buying is turned back on when in fact, it is not, well, unless you have 0 shares, you can buy 1… for now. 

**We need to continue to fight to get the buying restrictions on Robinhood lifted.** Sure you can yell at people to switch brokers but I don’t think it will have nearly as big an impact as getting the restriction lifted on RH.

Even with the heavy selling pressures, the hold is strong which is incredible, I am still holding too. Until the restriction is lifted, if you have a great broker that is reliable and easy to use, please drop it in the comments below for people to see! I use TD Ameritrade.",2021-01-29 21:17:05

- Who still as of now, allow options / non-margin purchasing of $GME, $AMC, $BB, $NOK, etc... THAT ARE UNRESTRICTED (RH's 5 shares of $GME is still BLATANT manipulation)

- Whose mobile app is decent

- If any brokerages have a lucrative bonus to leave RH

- etc, etc, etc,

Robinhood needs to feel the burn for that they have done, and what they continue to do. I'm not a millionaire, but I'm moving my account out by Monday. These fuckers wont earn money by holding mine.

Shkreli on GME - 1/31,705,l9p1xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9p1xu/shkreli_on_gme_131/,526,1612164584.0,"Gamestonk. Gamestop. GME. My thoughts are on Reddit, under my u/martinshkreli & subreddit r/martinshkreli. Those are authentic and discuss why GME is one of the most unprecedented events in market history. Here, I'm going to discuss the populist attitude that is creeping into this odd situation and add some thoughts on short-selling in general.
  
Let's cover my own unique angle on the concept of a 'short squeeze'. Most would define it as an erratic upward change in price driven by short-covering. I believe short-squeezes defined this way are usually a fictitious idee fixe that aggregates a number of discrete market behaviors and dynamics into a convenient and pithy moniker. The image of python-like buyer constricting some hapless speculator into a higher stock price is evocative but misleading. Many knew me as a short-selling specialist on Wall Street, focused on 'binary events' of biotech stocks. I think I've seen it all: I was once short more than 75% of a company's shares outstanding (I do not recommend this). I bought 75% of a company on the open market, etc.
  
Short-sellers are governed by the same market dynamics as longs. They get nervous when positions go against them and consider exiting. Like longs, they can double down if they wish. The only difference is that, of course, short positions grow when stocks rise. And they can rise infinitely, while long positions fall asymptotically to zero. But both get, theoretically and assuming no fundamental changes have occurred, more attractive as they move against the trader.
  
Short sellers have to pay borrow fees to longs (typically tiny, but sometimes massive). They have to locate stock to short, again usually easy, but sometimes difficult. Both are perilous when those rare adverse times arise. Why? Despite the possibility of a growing cost of renting stock, the ultimate fear of a short-seller is a ""buy-in"". It is nightmarish and has only happened to me once or twice, excluding options-related activity. A buy-in occurs when a broker decides to forcibly exit the short position on behalf of the trader because the broker and trader cannot secure the 'locate' which is supposed to underlie the short sale. The buy-in order is typically violently disruptive: a market order for the whole position near the closing hours of the market! The SEC published a list of stocks at risk of buy-in: the fail to deliver list.
  
My point is that a 'short squeeze' can only practically affect the trader for two reasons. The first is that the trader digs in, doubles down and doesn't exit as his position grows. That's bad trading, and will eventually blow the trader up. But, if the stock is a 'good short', that short will be replaced by more traders with stronger hands/a better entry price/smaller position. What's more is the average investor can't tell if this is happening! The second is the buy-in. I haven't heard GME shorts being bought in, but again, how would you know, other than the grapevine? My point is most of the disruptive, exciting trading here is simply long speculators banging away at the stock.
  
New longs are sometimes attracted to rising prices, speculating they'll increase further: that's called momentum. Those buyers are typically offset by the existing longs who are excited to exit at higher prices. But, if there is a large short position in the stock, a speculator may feel that those covering (buying to get out) short-sellers will provide additional fuel to the momentum. That's sometimes the case, but higher prices should lead to more supply from both long and short sellers. My feeling is the actions of large long holders probably have more influence on the stock price than shorts who dart in and out, and typically in smaller size. Remember that shorts who capitulate are often just replaced by new shorts who are attracted at the new lunar prices.
  
In essence, 'short squeezes' become a self-fulfilling prophecy as new long investors pile in trying to 'squeeze' this sometimes phantom of a short seller, and existing long investors may hold off selling for the same reason. With some Popperian skepticism you will easily see that the same dynamic can exist without the short boogeyman, or with a short boogeyman of any size. Speaking of which, where is Chanos and his slavish groupie, Carson Block? 
  
Speculative momentum can occur for any reason. Let's not forget that the 'trapping shorty' strategy is an awkward idea for a few reasons. Short sellers are often sophisticated market participants who are betting on the decline of a stock. You usually don't want these type of traders sniffing around your favorite longs: I recall writing a 'short report' on a stock to watch it fall 50% that day. If you do a study of stock returns of highly shorted stocks, they are pretty awful. The reason there is 'no arbitrage' is the borrow rate. 
  
But even if you got this poor short to capitulate and squeeze, the amount of buyers who are now holding stock at absurdly high prices put way more energy (and money) into the stock than the short seller's white towel ever could. A sledgehammer killed the fly: now what? Alternatively, are you the host or the parasite?
  
On populism. I don't really think most investors or speculators should go into any investment thinking that there is 'an enemy'. Concentrated (big) investments (bets) give rise to emotional behavior, typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking. It's a lot better to be Socratic with your 'opponent' and understand what they're thinking. If your position were to be half the size it currently is, would you be as emotionally interested? Try it! You'll lower your risk and feel better.
  
Some of the behavior going on at WSB sounds more jihadist than speculative. The idea that there are some investors who are 'good' and others who are 'bad', or that there is an 'establishment' is BS. Everyone has the same goal: I have a pile of money, I'm trying to make it bigger, fuck your pile--I don't care about it. Anything other goal is contrived, foolish and won't help you win. You can't 'fight the rich' by trying to become one of them. Don't you see the irony? A related thought experiment: what if this trade continued to work really well? And another, and another? Then some WSBers are billionaires. Aren't they the new 'enemy/establishment?'
  
Who do you think hedge fund managers are? They're typically the anti-establishment. Things have changed a bit, but the most successful HFMs are actually the WSBers of the past. These are guys who didn't fit in well at i-banks, often got kicked out for having big mouths or not wearing the right ties, or just wanting to wear jeans at work and not fill out TPS reports. When they started their firms, people like Soros, Icahn, Steinhardt, Robertson, Cohen, Griffin, Loeb (who has posted anonymously on boards), Samberg, even Cramer were fish out of water and had very tiny amounts of capital, often begging for investors.
  
The need for an enemy. To sustain increasingly insane behavior, it isn't uncommon to use a straw man or a scapegoat. Oppressive regimes used this technique in the past, and the media uses it today. Retail investors don't have much power individually. With your $5k RH account, you can't day trade or even qualify for margin. It's pitiful. So, it's understandably quite exciting to finally feel like a 'player' that you read about. To be a part of 'something'. The problem is the media is goading you to be somewhere between a lemming and a life-agnostic but impotent jihadist. Blowing yourself up won't impress anyone, and there is no afterlife here, other than a minimum wage career and mom's sofa. GME and shorting in general is small potatos in the scheme of the Wall St. machine. Don't worry about getting 'even' with the rich. That's jousting at a windmill that will waste your energy.
  
No one here, hopefully, wants to be a lemming. Those willing to 'die on this hill' have to realize something: Wall Street doesn't care about its speculators. The new traders who vanquish the old simply replace them. Nothing changes. When LTCM blew up, or Amaranth, Visium, Galleon, or anyone else, it is 'out with the old and in with the new'. So, perhaps WSB can blow up 1 hedge fund or maybe 5, but so what? Eventually, the tables will turn and it will blow up. The leveraged, fast-money trading markets are a violent place and the only people who care one whit are the brokers charging fees (directly or indirectly). They only care to make sure the sorry carcasses can pay their bills. They know there will always be another speculator lined up, ready to shove his money into the lotto machine. There is no pride here. There is no credit for being a good solider. You either survive or you don't. Your job is to survive and thrive. Becoming a lemming will guarantee failure as per the statistical truism of gambler's ruin (enjoy the proof in measure theory). With enough time, anyone playing a game with <50% success rate (equal payouts), will lose all their money. Get that number above 50%. Add the Kelly Criterion to your trading strategy.
  
You might ask, ""(that's all well and good OR we'll agree to disagree) but, Mr. Shrek, isn't this a good trading strategy? (ganging up on shorted stocks)?"" As long as you're not a lemming/jihadist (willing to walk over the cliff, whether or not you have a ""cause""), and you ignore a somewhat slimy ethical/market manipulation question, I don't see anything wrong with it. There are better ways to make money, since you're asking. Stoking (or worse, participating in) a buying frenzy that is akin to a forced musical chairs game is a little crazy. Once a stock is absurdly valued, you're just hoping the sell-off doesn't happen while you're holding it. If you have enough lemmings or jihadists 'helping you', that's a good thing. They will hold your bag--someone needs to. 
  
Of course, if you've found the ""next"" Microsoft or Apple, no one needs to hold any bags. But, no company can increase its objective (aka fair) value quickly enough for this... phenomenon? situation? absurdity?... to make it reasonable. Those things take years, go slow and steady, and this frenzied buying/""short squeeze"" phenomenon won't let value play a factor. That's why WSB GME longs have shifted theses from ""well, Gamestop was/is cheap"" to ""the gaming cycle"" to ""Ryan Cohen will save us"" to ""...jihad?!""
  
Each member of the herd has its own financial parameters, too. Some may have $500, some $50,000,000 or more. Some may be willing to lose their entire stake (and even more) on an out-of-the-money or levered trade. Some are not. Some were in the latter and somehow end up in the former. Some are in one column at one price and another column at another--some are switched from column to column by force. Today's lemmings/jihadists are tomorrow's sellers. When you're hanging off the mountain, pay attention to the guy holding the rope.
  
Loosely 'coordinated' buying can certainly affect stocks. Heavily shorted stocks and small cap stocks are the kind that require less capital than typical to 'move' a stock. The irony here is when putting on a position, the trader's goal is typically NOT to move the stock with his actions!
  
I still think GME is wildly overvalued, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm 'bearish'. One funny idea here is reflexivity: GME stockholders may become serious GME customers and the company's fundamentals improve that way! Excluding some such miracle, eventually GME stock will trade at <50 again. I still think it will trade at 1,000 or more BEFORE that happens, and that the decline process will take a long, long time (several years). Keep in mind, anything can change. GME can do serial secondaries that destroy its stock. Management's job is to create value for their shareholders--but perhaps they will avoid pissing them off. There's a strange loop! Finally, the stock could be halted by the SEC or completely banned by brokers. Don't overdo it. Watch the borrow rate. Keep your positions at less than 25% of your capital--live to play another day. 
  
Disclosure: I've never traded GME stock and do not intend to.

They have previously completely taken away buying power on these stocks from you guys, this caused serious backlash by users of the app forcing them to re-allow trading of these stocks, but not without a catch. There are purchase stock and option limits, which fluctuates throughout the trading hours to clearly manipulate the market, as seen with $BB and $GME today.

There also been plenty of people posting liquidation of their stocks without their approval, probably due to borrowing money on margin, but typically you should still have 5\~ days to fulfill the margin equity percentage requirement.

Anyways, that's besides the point:

What makes you think these retards won't fucking limit selling due to ""technical issues"" or have ANOTHER ""outage"" AGAIN. They'll let the hedgefucks liquidate, then allow us to sell after all the hedgefucks are out. C'mon tards you've seen this shit before during the SPY put days.

I'd move to Vanguard, Fidelity, or TD Ameritrade. Vanguard and Fidelity have $GME shares so surely they'll allow trading on $GME indefinitely.

GME thoughts from Shkreli - 1/26,694,l5rxsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5rxsh/gme_thoughts_from_shkreli_126/,256,1611736191.0,"Well, things are evolving, needless to say. I haven't talked to my WS people on the borrow situation. In my day, the best place to short stuff like this was actually the retail brokers, but NO hedge funds prime at these brokers and generally can't access these pools easily. A smart hedge fund has a little money at every broker he can, but it makes accounting and reconciliation a royal pain in the ass. Most hedge funds have 1-4 prime brokers. The very biggest have an account everywhere, but folks keep it centralized. Of course those prime brokers try to go around get 'borrow' for their clients, but typically they need to have someone custodial assets long (someone who owns gamestop) and then the rate is competitive. However, I'm pretty sure RH can give a locate/borrow to someone like Morgan Stanley (who incidentally bought eTrade). The borrow world is extremely opaque. IBKR sources borrows from lots of sources but they're a bit unique. It isn't uncommon from what I'm told for one desk to be paying a 50% fee to the client/lender and charging 75% to the borrower, capturing quite the spread. Back when I was short MNKD, the rate eclipsed 100%. Anyone know where it's at now?
  The next thing I'd say is the Melvin situation is unprecedented. SAC and Citadel have a lot of capital, but in the scheme of things, they're still hedge funds that aren't 10x or 100x bigger than Melvin. Well, there really aren't any hedge funds 10x bigger than Melvin, and the one that does exist (Bridgewater) doesn't get involved in individual stocks. The rest that are close are basically SAC, Citadel, etc, but they're only 2-5x bigger.
  The real question is, is Melvin out or not. My guess is they MUST have made the trade smaller given their losses. If I were Gabe I'd try to work the losses off, take a sort of ""one time charge"" (not really a thing in HFs) and move on. With discounted fees on new money he might survive, despite this being a big risk-management failure, it is quite the black/white swan. But I don't see Citadel/SAC investing knowing this trade is still on. That brings me to the next point.
  Yes, in the long run, I am bearish on GME. That means in 24 months the stock will almost certainly be lower than where it is today. That's what I do. I'm an investor. I've never been a great trader. That's probably because it's very hard to be a great trader. Even the best traders (think Cohen) are right around 55-60% of the time. You have to be nimble and accept losses quickly. Anything can happen here in the short run. Anything. The stock could go to 1,000. It'd be really stupid, but it could happen. I'm sure some of you are familiar with the ""max pain"" theory, that stocks tend to take the path that causes the most pain. That would be it.
  That doesn't mean I anything anyone should be buying GME. This is just the biggest poker game that ever has been played. It's really breathtaking. Longs know what their ultimate fate is, but it is sort of like Wily E Coyote. Whoever blinks first loses. In situations like this, I have found that BOTH sides typically lose. How? The shorts get blown up, obviously. After they get blown away, the greedy longs get blown up. The first-to-the-long guys are usually out pretty quickly (think 4 to 8, I'm done!) and the only ones who win. The first to the short guys typically stop out (idiots) or dig in (bigger idiots). If they dig in they almost never ride it out and get ""bought in"" or lose all their AUM through withdrawals or sometimes ""blow up"" (lose 100%+ of their capital). Blowing up means brokers take a loss, eg their prime broker. If I'm MS (Morgan Stanley) or someone like that, I'd be talking about my risk exposure to this trade lol. It reminds me of the old saying, ""lose $1 million, you have a big problem. lose $100 million, the bank has a big fucking problem."" At some point the chain of custody of the loss passes from LPs to the bank/brokerage. I'm sure some small hedge funds have already been wiped out.
  So, long story short (or short story long?), I still am firmly convinced GME is going nowhere from a fundamental standpoint. There will be no miracle Ryan turnaround that ever makes it worth $100+. But that doesn't mean the stock won't go up today, tomorrow, or even this whole quarter or half of the year or whole year. This is all a crazy Wall Street speculative frenzy and buying begets buying. I think there's a 30% chance it's all over and it goes down quite soon. A 30% chance it goes up, still quite a bit (30-50%) and blows off and then it's all over relatively soon. And then there's a 30% chance it doubles and then drops. And a 10% chance it could go up 10x before it is halted or there is some rule change or it eventually cracks.
  Whatever happens, you all made history. I'm kind of proud and kind of sick. Most importantly, I wish I was long! No position. Asked my people to look into shorting it over the weekend and told them today, yeaaah don't do that. I almost never trade as it's pretty difficult to invest from here and I think this one is probably too tricky to figure out without access to information (borrow movements, fund returns, etc.) If I had access to what all the borrow desks on the street are doing, friends at every fund who is a player in this debacle, returns from the funds themselves, one could kind of map out what is happening. Robin Hood level information would be the best, but clearly no one has that (except for Citadel lol). 
  Good luck to all, be careful (don't have more than half of your money in GME, don't use margin) and I hope you all make a fortune.

Vladimir Tenev & Baiju Bhatt (Co-Founders of Robinhood) are ex-High Frequency Traders -- An Expose.,674,l7mran,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7mran/vladimir_tenev_baiju_bhatt_cofounders_of/,83,1611935114.0,"Vlad Tenev (CEO) & Baiju Bhatt (Co-founder) are ex-High Frequency Traders. They started out their careers as HFTs to engage in market manipulation & front running for profit. Only then did they realize that selling order flow to allow other HFTs to front-run and manipulate the markets was a much more profitable & scalable business than being an HFT themselves. Thus Robinhood was born.

**Source:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir\_Tenev**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tenev)

""In 2010, Tenev and Bhatt started a [high-frequency trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading) company called Celeris. By January 2011 they abandoned it to create Chronos Research, which sold low-latency software to other trading firms and banks.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tenev#cite_note-techcrunch.com-6)

In 2013, Tenev and Bhatt co-founded the trading platform Robinhood.""

As ex-HFTs, they 100% knew what they were doing today by halting buy orders on Gamestop.

I don't doubt that Robinhood's clearing firm Apex Corporation was under massive stress / risk of short sellers not being able to cover their positions with $GME's price above $400 and only trending upwards. Hell, Interactive Brokers Chairman openly said that on CNBC [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision).

However by forcing their customers to not be able to buy $GME, and also allow them to sell $GME and actively close positions of users who artificially were forced into a margin call by MMs trading the stock down on low volume is disgusting.

They KNEW that by allowing users to not be able to buy $GME, but to be able sell $GME, MMs would to take advantage of the sell pressure & low volume on the stock in order to tank the price. They KNEW that some of their users would panic sell or be liquidated by margin calls from the artificially decrease in price by MMs from $450 to $150 after the halt. They also KNEW that once the price dropped enough, due to manufactured sell pressure, shorts could cover enough of their positions so that the stress on clearance houses would be eased and all order in the world of HFTs would be restored.

If Vlad & Baiju were actually looking out for their users, and not their actual customers the HFTs, they would have restricted all purchases & sales of Gamestop stock or placed a 1-2 halt on all trading of $GME. Clearly, they did not do that and it shows who Robinhood actually serves -- the HFTs they once aspired to be.

As Munger, says ""**Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome**.""

From the inception these guys never had your best interests at heart and I assume that's what Chamath was not so subtly alluding to [here](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526).

Lastly, I was a Robinhood customer for 3 years until I started trading options back in March when I joined this sub (best thing that's ever happened to me). It became very clear to me after a few months how openly HFTs were front running our order flow on RH, since my option orders would only fill once the bid / ask spread comfortably passed my limit order or limit sell.

I then switched to Fidelity, TD, and now Schawb. Please do yourself a favor and once you sell your $GME positions get yourself a real broker & never do business with someone so clearly acting against your interests for their personal gain. Fidelity, eTrade, Schawb, and SoFi are all great options as brokers.

**TLDR --**

1. **Vlad Tenev & Baiju Bhatt are ex-HFT scum.**
2. **Robinhood was founded on the idea that selling order flow to HFTs is a much better & more scalable business than being a HFT yourself.**
3. **RH (Vlad & Baiju) knew that stopping the ability for their users to purchase shares would artificially tank the price.**
4. **If Vlad or Baiju had any self respect, believed in their fiduciary duty to his users, and didn't have the HFTs paying his bills they would have halted all purchases & sales of GME shares.**
5. **Once the squeeze is over never use Robinhood again.**
6. **I like the stock 🚀🌕🚀🌗🚀🌑**

A BIG OL FUCKIN RED DAY MAY BE COMING,675,l7v3we,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7v3we/a_big_ol_fuckin_red_day_may_be_coming/,164,1611962397.0,"First off, read the fucking TLDR because I’m sick of responses from people who didn’t even glance at the post. 


Congratulations and holy fuck to those of you in the GME Squeeze. I was a doubter. I missed the boat entirely, but I bought 3 shares this morning at an average of 334 and I’ll hold to oblivion. Seriously. This 1k means absolutely nothing to me. I went 99.9% cash yesterday and I will hold this last tiny remaining position until it’s a penny or I hit my sell limit at $4200.

Some of you may have seen this post yesterday 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I believe this is true. 

This explains the broad market selloff of everything besides squeeze stocks this past week aside from yesterday, and the continued bleed today now that the strategy of forcing the squeezers out by restricting trade seems to have failed. 

I had 20k wiped off my account value in hours the other day. That’s not important because it was house money. What’s important is *what caused that fear* and the answer to that may be: a liquidity crisis. 

What happens if brokers like IBKR and RH fail? If they are forced to admit margin is ineffective, their risk management systems are flawed, and short squeeze scenarios like this reveal that *they do not have the ability to cover the cash that flows through their institutions*? 

What happens if these hedge funds who went naked short get fully liquidated in margin calls *and don’t have the money to back it up?*

Not only are we bound to see a *firestorm* of legislation that could scare the markets, the actual *void* of money that will be created could tank everything. 

What would the impacts be of Robinhood failing? If *everyone* who has their money in the market via RH pulls out because they’re not sure that their broker actually *has* the money to pay them? 

TLDR: If the squeeze gets fully squoze, I am pretty certain the entire market will tank (**with the exception of the squeeze stocks**) Therefore, please keep squeezing, because I want cheap stocks.

YOU FUCKIN WRONG CAUSE WE GOT SOME HOMIES ON DECK ROBINHOODS JUST A SMALL INDIE COMPANY COMPARED TO THEM

A PREFACE: DO NOT XFER OUT OF RH. THIS ADVICE IS FOR NEW BUYERS ONLY OR FOR THOSE WHO HOLD MORE THAN 5 SHARES IN RH AND WANT TO BUY MORE. ANYONE BOUGHT ON RH, DISABLE STOP LIMIT. DISABLE MARGIN, AND HOLD ON CASH.

Lets get this shit out of the way right now. The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further WE GOT TOO FUCKING BIG!. GOOD! due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required.

So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are...

🚀🚀Fidelity and Vanguard🚀🚀. You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail.

This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.

TLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. They will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.

Take this opportunity by the balls and never let go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Just relax, no need to panic, I'm sure things will get better. Do something different today for your wellbeing. Set a price alert and put your phone down.

Don't forget, only spend what you can afford to lose in the worst case scenario. I bought some stocks because I can afford to lose it all and it won't make a difference to my financial circumstances. 

We all knew HF were crooks and never played fairly; the GME move just proved this fact and illustrated that these scums will do anything in their power, including but not limited to, openly breaking the laws and regulation, in order to win. Needless to say, they must be so frustrated right now because none of their tactics have really worked: market manipulation (stopping the public from buying freely by bribing shit brokers like RH), ladder attack (selling to their own partners to bring the price down), use of media to spread fake news, bribing government officials and so on. I feel like the more they try the more they fail. 

I'm sure our FCA is a lot better than your SEC when it comes to bringing the scums down. It seems your SEC is ran by some cowboys / sponsored lawyers. What I don't understand is what in the world is FBI doing when HF are openly committing crime in daylight?!

This was done without my permission when I already had a limit order set. The market value of the contracts, including both the bid and ask, were nowhere hear 15 bucks. A friend sold his an hour before me for $700 and they ended the day costing over $500. 

People keep telling me this was due to assignment risk or pin risk. My understanding is that neither of these apply to me. And if they did RH cannot just sell my contracts for any value that they choose.

If you trade with RH or one of the other brokers that has limited trading on GME, don't give in and sell. Sign up at another broker, a real one and initiate a transfer-in-kind. Yes, it will take weeks for the shares to arrive at the new broker but this short interest isn't going to unwind itself for weeks anyway. Don't sell! By transferring the assets in kind, Robin Hood will have to send the shares to your new broker and keep them in your name. They can limit which stocks trade on their platform but they can't limit transfers out.

I am holding my $GME into the ground if I need to because I don’t want 💎🙌 boning my mom. 

But I’m buying the hell out of $BB rn. It is by far the lowest risk of the bunch with real fundamentals behind it. That’s why it’s been able to hold the line better than the rest.

This is a legit tech company with some solid patents and breakout potential with big partnerships on the horizon. 

What’s more, $BB has been shorted to hell like all of the rest. The same people who doubled down on their shorts on $AMC and $GME have been hammering down on $BB to spread the risk, except they seriously messed up here as this one actually has sharp teeth.

Short volumes have been lower than the others but still through the roof: http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html

There won’t be the same level squeeze we saw with $GME but there’s going to be a squeeze.  This is a SAFE $30 stock in the very near future.
